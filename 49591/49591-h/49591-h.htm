<h2>IN AFRICAN FOREST AND JUNGLE</h2>



<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="i2">A CANOE-VOYAGE TO THE COUNTRY OF ROTEMBO
THE CHIEF&mdash;A TOILET OF CEREMONY&mdash;ROTEMBO's
GROTESQUE COSTUME&mdash;A FORMAL RECEPTION&mdash;SPEECHES
OF ROTEMBO AND MYSELF&mdash;A DANCE IN
MY HONOR&mdash;MY PRESENTS TO THE CHIEF&mdash;WE
BECOME GOOD FRIENDS</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> canoe that took me from King Mombo to
Rotembo the Chief was a dug-out made of a
huge tree, and was of great length. On its prow was
carved the head of a growling leopard. It was paddled
by forty men. Rikimongani, the nephew of
King Mombo, steered, and had the stick Omemba
(the snake) with him to show that he carried the
message of his uncle King Mombo to Rotembo
the Chief.</p>

<p>Near the prow were two men who beat two tomtoms
furiously almost all the time, which was to show
that they were on an important mission.</p>

<p>The sun was very hot, and the heat was intense.
The black oily skins of the men shone as if they had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
been eelskins. The river banks were lined with mangrove
trees, supported on their tall roots, and as the
tide was low, we could see multitudes of oysters growing
round them.</p>

<p>We passed at last the region of the mangrove
trees, which only grow where the tide is felt and
where the banks of the rivers are flat. Then the
banks of the Ogobai river became hilly and clad
with the trees of the forest to their very top.
Here and there a flock of gray parrots with red
tails were feeding on fruits, or a troop of monkeys
was seen.</p>

<p>The following day, as we were approaching the village
of Rotembo the Chief, we landed, and the men
made their toilet so as to appear at their best when
they arrived at the village of Rotembo.</p>

<p>Rikimongani put a shirt on, and a high silk hat&mdash;this
was the costume he wore on state occasions. He
was the best dressed man of the company.</p>

<p>Then we re-embarked, and as we paddled the men
began to sing, and to beat the tomtoms furiously.
Soon the village of Rotembo came in sight. Then the
men sang louder than before, and their song was&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="line">"We come with the great Oguizi,</div>
<div class="line">The great friend of King Mombo,</div>
<div class="line">To Rotembo the great Chief;"</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and they repeated these words over and over. They
began to fire guns, thus showing that they were on a
great mission and that it was an occasion worth wasting
powder for.</p>

<p>As we came opposite the village of Rotembo, we
suddenly turned towards the land, with the head of
our canoe facing the village. Rikimongani stood up
now so that the people on shore could recognize him.
We landed in the midst of singing, tomtom-beating,
and gun-firing.</p>

<p>As my paddlers jumped out of the canoe, they
shouted to the great number of people that had
come to look at us: "We are men! We are men!
We have come with the great Oguizi." Then all
became silent, and we passed through the people
walking until we came to a large structure with a
roof supported by pillars. There we waited for
Rotembo the Wise, surrounded by hundreds of
villagers.</p>

<p>Soon we heard the noise of the kendo, a rude iron
bell, the emblem of chiefs. Rotembo was coming.
As he rang it, he invoked the spirits of his ancestors
to be with him, and soon I saw his tall erect form
walking towards us.</p>

<p>He kept beating the kendo, and at last came under
the great shed and walked towards the stool that was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
next to mine, then looked at me without saying a
word and seated himself.</p>

<p>Rotembo was dressed with a waistcoat, a shirt, and
an old silk hat, which to judge by its shape and shabbiness
must have been at least twenty-five years old.
He was covered with mondahs, or charms, that he
believed had the power of preventing any harm from
coming to him.</p>

<p>Then Rikimongani, with Omemba, the stick of King
Mombo, in his hand, delivered the words of King
Mombo to his uncle, saying:</p>

<p>"My uncle King Mombo, who loves you dearly,
sends the Oguizi to you. You must take care of
him, give him food and water and all he asks of you.
Let him go into the forest and hunt, and give him the
best hunters that you have. Let him have his own
way, and when he gets tired of the country, give him
people, as I have done, to take him where he wants
to go."</p>

<p>Upon this Rotembo got up and said: "It was
kind of my kinsman King Mombo to send to me the
great Oguizi. I will do what King Mombo has told
me to do." Then addressing me, he said: "Oguizi,
we have heard of you. Your fame is great all over
the land. You are known as the good Oguizi. I
want you to love me as you love King Mombo."</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="Rotembo"><img src="images/i_018.png" width="500"

<div class="caption">
<i>The meeting with Rotembo.</i>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
"Rotembo, great Chief," I replied, "I wish to go
and live in the forest. I desire to kill all the wild
beasts I can and stuff them. I want to kill three or
four of every kind of all the birds of the country and
stuff them. I want to catch all the butterflies and
insects I can and keep them. I wish to take
them to the land of the Oguizis, and show there
the creatures seen in the great forest where the black
man lives."</p>

<p>Rotembo's eyes seemed to become twice as large as
they were before when he heard me speak in this
manner. He looked at me with wonder and awe.</p>

<p>I said to him: "I mean what I say, and when you
see me return from the forest you will find that I told
you the truth and several canoes will be required for
the skins of the animals I shall collect."</p>

<p>"You shall go into the forest," said Rotembo,
"and stay with my slaves or people that are living
there."</p>

<p>Then, in presence of all the people of his village,
he presented me with a goat, six chickens, and nine
eggs, and a number of bunches of plantain. Here
an egg has the same value as a chicken, for, as
the people say, out of the egg comes the chicken.
These presents showed that I was welcomed.</p>

<p>Rotembo was the chief of one of the clans that com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>posed
his tribe, and in case of war his people, scattered
in a goodly number of small villages, could
muster many warriors.</p>

<p>Rotembo was tall, walked very erect, and had a
commanding appearance. His hair was white; several
ugly scars told of his warlike character and experiences
in days gone by. When young he loved war, and the
people feared him. Now that he had become old he
loved peace, and his neighbors and people were happy
on that account.</p>

<p>In the midst of vociferous cheers he put his kendo,
the emblem of a chieftain, upon my left shoulder;
then said with a loud voice: "During the time you
stay with me you will be our chief; we will all obey
you." After these words the tomtoms beat furiously,
and guns were fired.</p>

<p>The speech-making being over, my men went to
our canoe and brought back the goods I had with me.
I had come to Rotembo rich, for I had brought twenty
brass kettles, one hundred copper rods, a goodly
number of bunches of beads, looking-glasses, fire
steel and flints, files, and my "precious box," which I
valued more than everything else I possessed, for in
that box were the instruments and books which
helped me to know my latitude and longitude, and
the days of the week and of the month when I had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
forgotten them, which was not uncommon after attacks
of fever.</p>

<p>That evening we had a great dance, given in my
honor. Rotembo himself danced before me in a most
eccentric manner, making great contortions. His
people applauded him vociferously. The women
danced also.</p>

<p>The following evening, when every one was asleep,
Rotembo came with Oyaya, his head wife, to get the
presents I had for him. He also, like all the other
chiefs to whom I made presents, implored me not to
tell anyone of the things I gave him.</p>

<p>After a few days' feasting, King Mombo's people
returned to their country. Rotembo and I became
very great friends in a short time. He came often to
see me, for he was always delighted to hear my musical
box and Waterbury clock talk to me. He liked
to see my matches start fire suddenly, and he always
wondered at my magnet. Once in a while I would
give him little presents which he put in the bag he
carried on his shoulder and which contained his small
idol. No one ever thought that in the bag were
bunches of beads and various other trinkets.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="i2">I PROPOSE TO GO INTO THE FOREST TO HUNT&mdash;ROTEMBO
PROMISES ME THREE GIFTS&mdash;ROGALA,
THE FAMOUS HUNTER, THE FIRST OF THEM&mdash;DESCRIPTION
OF ROGALA&mdash;ANDEKKO, THE DOG, THE
SECOND GIFT&mdash;NDOVA, THE MONKEY, THE THIRD&mdash;HOW
NDOVA WAS CAPTURED AND REARED&mdash;I GIVE
ROTEMBO SOME OF MY HAIR.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> day after I had been in the village some time,
being in the house of Rotembo, I said to him:
"I have been with you quite a while, and I wish now
to go far into the forest. I wish you to give me a
man whom you trust, a great hunter, who is not afraid
of danger and who can face with his gun the most
ferocious beasts of the country. He and I will live
together in the forest."</p>

<p>Rotembo looked at me with great astonishment, for
he wondered why I wished to go and live in the forest
by myself with only one man.</p>

<p>He remained silent for a minute or two, thinking
deeply; then he said: "Oguizi, I will give you three
gifts to go with you in the forest."</p>

<p>"What are they?" I asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will not tell you now," he replied, "but you
will know when they are before you."</p>

<p>Then we separated, I wondering what were to be
the three gifts Rotembo was to give me.</p>

<p>Four days passed by, and on the fifth, while I was
seated by the side of Rotembo, a strange-looking man
came before him, and bending very low took hold of
his foot and said: "To do your bidding your faithful
slave has come."</p>

<p>I looked at the man with great curiosity, and learned
that his name was Rogala and that he was one of the
most famous hunters in the country.</p>

<p>Rogala was of medium height and exceedingly well
proportioned. His legs and arms were very muscular
and as hard as wood. His chest was broad, and his
hands and feet were small,&mdash;a very common occurrence
among the people of the forest. His eyes were full
of fire and daring. He had a fighting chin, and he
appeared to be about forty years old. Scars upon one
of his legs told where a leopard had once wounded
him. He wore a huge head-dress of eagle's feathers.
His eyelids were painted red, and a red stripe from
the nose upward divided his forehead in two parts.
The face was painted white, and on each side of the
mouth were two round red spots. He was covered
with mondahs, or charms. One of these protected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
him against witchcraft; another made him invulnerable
against bullets, spears, or poisoned arrows&mdash;in a word,
every one of them protected him against some evil or
other.</p>

<p>Rotembo said to me: "I can trust Rogala more
than any other man in the country. I bought him
when he was quite young, and he has forgotten
the language of his tribe. He faces without fear the
ngina (gorilla), the elephant, the leopard, and the
fiercest bear of the country. He has killed during
his life more than one hundred elephants and he has
kept all their tails as proofs. The number of hippopotami
that have fallen under his gun is very great;
the necklace I wear round my neck is made of the
canines of some of the leopards he has killed."</p>

<p>I counted forty-eight of them; so Rogala had killed
twelve leopards for the chief's necklace. He himself
wore one with twenty-four canines; so before
me were the witnesses of eighteen leopards that he
had killed.</p>

<p>As I looked at Rogala, I said to myself: "He is
just the kind of man I should like to take into the
forest with me."</p>

<p>"Rogala is one of the three gifts I have promised
you," said Rotembo.</p>

<p>I thanked the chief for the gift of Rogala, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>upon
he said to him: "You know that I have always
treated you well. Several times when I wanted to
marry the daughters of chiefs they said, 'Only upon
one condition can you marry my daughter, and that
is, that you give me Rogala.' I always refused them,
for I would not part with you."</p>

<p>I did not wonder at it, for if Rogala had killed over
one hundred elephants, the barter of their tusks had
brought wealth to Rotembo.</p>

<p>"I have given you to the Oguizi while he is in my
country," continued the chief. "You must take care
of him as you do of me. You must follow him in
the forest. You must sleep by his side. You must
face the wild beasts with him, and show him that
Rogala's heart knows no fear. Put no shame on me
by running away before danger; if you do you might
just as well die in the jaws of a wild beast, for I
myself will kill you. He is my Oguizi, and I love
him. See that he is never hungry or thirsty."</p>

<p>While the chief was talking, Rogala listened reverently.
When Rotembo had done speaking, Rogala
said: "Chief, the best of masters, Rogala always does
what you order him to do. I will do all you say,
and follow the Oguizi wherever he goes, and live with
him in the great forest and hunt with him. I will
take care of him just as if he were my sweetheart."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rogala," said I, "I will be your friend. When
we get into the forest, we will be like two men who
are born the same day." Among the Africans of the
great forest, when two men are born the same day,
they are foster brothers.</p>

<p>"Good indeed you are, Oguizi," replied Rogala.
"I will obey you in everything."</p>

<p>Then I presented him with a big hunting-knife,
which pleased him greatly.</p>

<p>The following day, while I was seated by Rotembo
under the veranda of his house, I saw Rogala coming
towards us. He had with him a very strange-looking
dog.</p>

<p>Rotembo said to me: "Look at this dog. His
name is Andekko. He is fearless and always in the
thick of the fight. He is not afraid of any wild
beast. In war he always warns us of an enemy hiding
in the jungle. He is the best of hunting dogs.
He goes into the forest all alone in search of game,
and will drive the antelope or gazelle up to Rogala
or the hunter he knows, even if it takes him the whole
day to do so. He has captured several young nginas
and nshiegos after their mothers were killed, and gone
into the lair of leopards and killed their young.
The wonder is that he has not been killed by a
gorilla or leopard long before now or been gashed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
two by a boar or disabled by monkeys. Many times
he will prevent you from being hungry while you are
in the forest."</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="Andekko"><img src="images/i_028.png" width="500"
height="783" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
<i>Rogala and Andekko</i>.
</div></div>

<p>I gazed at Andekko with wonder, he looked so
very ugly. He was covered with scars, marks of the
wounds he had received in his conflicts with wild
animals. One of his ears was split in two. His
upper and lower lips were also cut on the left side.
These two wounds had been made by a large monkey,
called a mandril, which often walks on the ground
and had been surprised there by Andekko.</p>

<p>Rotembo, seeing that I was looking at the scars
of Andekko, said: "Oguizi, when wounded, this
dog becomes even fiercer and more courageous than
before. He is famous for his courage."</p>

<p>Andekko belonged to the same family of dogs as
those that had gone gorilla-hunting with me at
King Mombo's plantation. His hair was of yellowish
color, and he had a white spot on his throat. His
tail could not have been more curly, and he was
quite lean; his legs were somewhat long.</p>

<p>Then Rotembo said: "Oguizi, Andekko is the
second gift I promised you."</p>

<p>The next day Rogala came again, but this time with
a monkey called Ndova. He was a fine creature, with
a nice coat of hair and a white nose. The chief, point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>ing
to the monkey, said: "His name is Ndova, and he
has the intelligence of a man. He goes with Rogala
into the forest. We have given him the name of
Ndova because the species of monkeys to which he
belongs is so called. You will not often be hungry
in the forest when Ndova is with you, for he will call
upon other ndovas to come to him while he stands
close to you and Rogala, and when these come you
will shoot them. You will have plenty of monkey
meat to eat. When monkeys are fat," he added,
"they taste fine, especially if they are broiled on a
bright charcoal fire. While living on my plantations,
I often take Ndova with me. He can only call on
his fellow ndovas, for the other species do not understand
his talk.</p>

<p>"There will be days," added Rotembo, "when you
will find no monkeys or other game and hunger will
come upon you. Then Ndova must follow you.
There are many kinds of fruits, berries, and nuts
in the forest; these look very tempting, but several
of them are very poisonous, and people die if they
eat them. So when you see any fruit, berries, or nuts
you do not know, do not eat them until you give
them to Ndova first. If he eats them, these are also
good for you."</p>

<p>"Monkeys never make a mistake; they have a gift<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which no man possesses. By the sense of smell they
can tell if a berry, nut, or fruit is poisonous. They
always smell a thing they do not know before eating it,
and when it is poisonous they throw it away. If it
is not poisonous, they give it a bite. In that case
what is good for the monkey is good for the man.
But I must tell you that often the nuts, berries, or
fruits a monkey likes men do not like, for monkeys
and men have not always the same taste."</p>

<p>After hearing the words of Rotembo I looked with
renewed curiosity at Ndova. He was almost as
large as Andekko. His nose was white, which contrasted
strongly with the color of his dark hair tipped
with whitish gray. He had long canine teeth. I was
glad to hear he was gentle, for I should not have liked
to be bitten by him.</p>

<p>"Oguizi, I give you Ndova," Rotembo said. "He
is the third gift I promised you. I think you will
get on well in the forest with Rogala, Andekko,
and Ndova. There are two other of my slaves who
are also great hunters. Their names are Shinshooko
and Alapai. These three men live close together in
the forest and spend their lives in hunting; they
have their families with them.</p>

<p>"I got Ndova in the following manner," he continued.
"I and my slave Rogala were hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
together near the plantation where you are going.
We were lying in wait for boars, when finally we
heard their grunts. We heard at the same time
the chatter of monkeys above our heads. The boars
came in sight and we fired. Then, to our astonishment,
a little monkey fell from the tree above our
heads. The firing of our guns had frightened his
mother, who dropped him. He did not have the
strength to hold on to the branches. I seized the
little fellow and put him into my bag. The mother
followed all the way back to the plantation, uttering
cries of distress and anger. Sometimes she would
come down to the ground, look at us, and go up
into the trees again. She did not dare to approach
too near us. After coming to the house we fed the
little monkey with the milk of a goat and called
him Ndova. His mother at the same time remained
on a commanding tree close by, calling the little fellow.
Soon she was joined by her mate, who added
his calls to hers. They slept on a tree near the
plantation that night, and we kept the baby in the
house. At daylight the two big monkeys were still
on the same tree, and uttered cries of anguish and
distress, calling for the little fellow, but did not
dare to come down.</p>

<p>"Three days passed and we thought little Ndova's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
mother had got tired and gone away for good into the
forest, leaving her offspring to his fate, for we no
longer heard her cries.</p>

<p>"We made a little bed of leaves and used to leave
Ndova upon it in the sun. We had gone into our
huts one afternoon. After a while I came out of the
house and just in time. For Ndova's mother had
apparently been watching from a tree and seeing nobody
had come down and had taken hold of Ndova
and was carrying him away into the forest as fast as
she could. I shouted with all my might, and Ndova
lost his hold and dropped to the ground.</p>

<p>"We went into the forest and made a trap to catch
the mother, and brought the little monkey and put
him in the trap. We were then sure that she would
come and see him and try to get him away. When
everything was ready, we hid and waited. After a
time we saw a monkey quietly coming down a tree.
It was the mother; we recognized her by her white
nose. She uttered a sound of joy as she approached
Ndova. Then she got into the cage, and the trap-door
closed behind her.</p>

<p>"When we came towards the cage, the big monkey
was much frightened. We took the cage with us.</p>

<p>"The mother nursed the little one for over ten
moons (months), and after that she stayed with him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
until she died. By that time Ndova could take care
of himself, and had learned the language of the ndova
monkeys from his mother.</p>

<p>"After the death of his mother, Rogala took
Ndova, who had grown fond of him, into the forest
every day, to find food for himself, leading him by a
string. Often the monkeys of his kind would come
around above his head and talk to him, and Ndova
would answer them. After a time Rogala tied a long
rope to Ndova, so that he might go higher up the
trees after fruits. Then came the time when Ndova
could talk very loud and call other ndovas to him,
and Rogala found that Ndova had become very useful.
Rogala, Ndova, and Andekko are now three inseparable
friends. Ndova and Andekko are great chums,
for they love to play together."</p>

<p>I thanked Chief Rotembo for his valuable gifts, and
said that they would be of great service to me, and
promised that when ready to leave the country I
would return Ndova and Andekko to him.</p>

<p>When Rogala heard these words, a broad grin of
satisfaction overspread his face. He was the keeper
of Andekko and Ndova, both of whom were his constant
companions. He was afraid that Rotembo had
given them to me for all time.</p>

<p>I gave a bone to Andekko, who was inclined to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
growl at me at first, and a ripe plantain to Ndova, who
gave a peculiar "<i>Oh oh</i>" to show his joy. I found
afterward that Ndova was very fond of ripe plantains
and bananas.</p>

<div class="caption">
<i>Ndova's mother tries to carry him away into the forest.</i>
</div></div>

<p>"I will feed Ndova and Andekko often," said I
to Rogala, "so that they may get accustomed to
me."</p>

<p>I often think that if it had not been for Andekko
and Ndova I should probably have died of starvation
in the great forest.</p>

<p>A few days afterwards Rotembo came to me and
said: "Oguizi, I want you to give me some of your
hair. I shall consider this the greatest gift that I have
ever received."</p>

<p>My hair had become very long and hung over my
shoulders. I had let it grow, for it excited great
wonder among the natives. It was very black and
silky. So I pulled out half a dozen hairs and presented
them to Rotembo. As soon as he received
the gift, he muttered words I could not understand,
then took his little idol from the bag that always
hung by his side, and wound two of the hairs round
and round its neck. The four others he carefully
put aside in a little wooden box. After this he
looked perfectly happy, and said to me, "Oguizi,
the six long hairs you have given me are more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
valuable in my eyes than many tusks of elephants,
brass kettles, wives, or slaves."</p>

<p>I often wished I had had flaxen hair and blue eyes
instead of black hair and hazel eyes, for I should
then have appeared still more wonderful in the eyes
of these wild and savage men.</p>

WITHIN RANGE&mdash;WE KILL TWO OF THEM&mdash;FEEDING
ON ROAST MONKEY&mdash;A DESERTED HOUSE&mdash;A STORY
OF WITCHCRAFT</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">A short</span> time after I received these gifts from
Rotembo, I made preparations to enter the great
forest, to live with Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai,
and Andekko the dog, and Ndova the monkey.</p>

<p>I put all my things together,&mdash;the precious tin box
containing my sextant, etc., matches, and a bottle containing
my quicksilver, a little iron pot, a frying-pan,
a small coffee-pot, three pairs of laced boots, some
fire steel with flints, files, two axes, one machete, and
some medicines. I took also a shot-gun, my rifle
"Bulldog," and a lighter rifle, powder, and ammunition.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, I called Rogala, and
showing him the "precious box," I said to him: "Of
all the things I possess, I think most of this box.
You alone shall carry it on your back,, and no one
must ever open it, for if he does, great misfortune will
happen to him."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>At daylight the following morning we loaded our
canoe with my outfit, Rogala carrying my "precious
box." Rotembo and his people followed us to the
shore, and when we were ready to start, in a loud
voice Rotembo invoked the spirits of his ancestors,
Kombe and others, to follow me. After we had left
I saw him seated on the ground before his little idol,
talking to it. The last words we heard from him
were: "Rogala, take good care of the Oguizi. Good-bye,
Oguizi;" and after passing a bend of the river
we lost sight of the village.</p>

<p>The prow of our canoe was a carved crocodile
head with an open mouth holding a man between
its jaws.</p>

<p>Ndova and Andekko had been tied near it. Ndova
uttered the peculiar intonation meaning pleasure.
Andekko was wagging his tail and looking at Rogala.
Both seemed to know that they were going home.</p>

<p>During the day we saw swimming in the stream a
number of elephants. They were playing and throwing
water high into the air with their trunks. They swam
hither and thither, and as we came nearer we saw that
each elephant had a little baby elephant apparently
standing on the back of its mother. Rogala was in a
state of great excitement; he wanted to land and
walk along the banks of the river and have a shot at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the elephants. "No," said I, "each of these elephants
has a little one to care for."</p>

<p>Further on we saw in the distance, near the other bank
of the river, two canoes descending the stream. They
were full of men in war-paint and armed with spears
and war-axes. They were singing their war-songs and
beating their tomtoms fiercely. Rogala's face became
anxious. I asked who they were.</p>

<p>"I do not know, Oguizi," he replied.</p>

<p>Instantly we laid hands upon our guns ready to
fight, but when we were near enough to hear the
warriors' song of victory, Rogala recognized that
they belonged to the clan of Rotembo. But we were
paddling so near the banks of the river that they did
not see us.</p>

<p>Towards evening Rogala, pointing to a spot near the
river, said: "Oguizi, this is a place where I camp for
the night when I am on the river. Close by is a
beautiful little spring of clear water coming out of the
earth, cool and delicious to drink. We never drink
the water from running rivers when we can help it."</p>

<p>I answered: "All right, Rogala; we will camp
where you say."</p>

<p>Accordingly we made camp here and passed the
night. The following afternoon we entered a narrow
river and left the large Ogobai. We had not been two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
hours on our way up the river when Ndova began
to utter loud and peculiar sounds.</p>

<p>"Ndova is calling the monkeys to come to him,"
said Rogala. "If they come we shall have monkey
meat for our evening meal."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he grinned with delight; but there
were no monkeys within the sound of Ndova's voice.</p>

<p>After a while, however, the call of Ndova was
answered by a troop of monkeys, and they seemed to
have quite a conversation together, though the voices
of the monkeys did not seem to come nearer.</p>

<p>"The monkeys are trying to make Ndova come
to them," Rogala said.</p>

<p>Then came a pause, and the forest became still
again. But soon Rogala's quick ears heard the
noise made by the shaking of the branches of trees.
The monkeys were travelling towards us, leaping
from branch to branch, bending them by their
weight as they alighted upon them.</p>

<p>Ndova was making an awful noise and was very
excited. The monkeys answered him, and he kept
on calling them. We were paddling silently along
the banks of the river, and as soon as we saw the
monkeys on a tree above our canoe we stopped.
They were many in number, and looked at Ndova
without uttering a sound, they seemed so astonished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
We raised our guns and aimed at the two biggest
white-nosed ones and fired. One fell into our canoe,
the other dropped dead by the shore. The rest
scuttled away in a trice.</p>

<p>"Good for you, Ndova," I said to him.</p>

<p>Ndova was in a great state of excitement. Rogala,
holding his cord, took him towards the two dead
monkeys. When he came near them he uttered
other sounds, quite unlike those he had made when
he called the monkeys to us. What he meant neither
Rogala nor I could tell. But I said to myself:
"Rotembo is right. Ndova will be the cause of our
having food and we shall feed often on monkey
meat. We shall not starve as long as Ndova is with
us. Great, indeed, is the gift of Chief Rotembo!"</p>

<p>A few miles further on we landed. In a short
time we were seated by a bright fire, and when it
had been reduced to a great mass of charcoal we
roasted one of the monkeys and with our roasted
plantains made a delicious meal. Andekko fed on
some of the bones, and Ndova on a ripe plantain.</p>

<p>At dawn of day we left our encampment. About
two hours afterwards we came upon three little houses
surrounded by plantain trees. The houses were in
a dilapidated state and had been abandoned. The
large bunches of plantain that were hanging from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the trees were untouched, for the elephants and the
big apes, the "men of the woods," had not found
the plantation.</p>

<p>Some time before we had reached the place Rogala's
face had become uneasy. He took to the opposite
bank of the river. I could see fear on his countenance.
He paddled faster than ever, and his mind
seemed quite relieved when we had left the spot
far behind us. Then he stopped, tied the canoe
to a tree to rest a while, and said: "Two dry seasons
ago there lived on the plantation we have passed
a man by the name of Igala. His wife was called
Yienoo. Both were sorcerers, and had been so for
a long time, though the people did not know it.
Near them was a village. One day one of the men of
the village was trampled to death by a bull elephant,
and there was great sorrow among the people. The
day after a leopard came into the village at night and
carried away a woman. The people began to think
it was strange that those two deaths should occur
one immediately after the other, and they became
much alarmed, and believed that witchcraft was the
cause of the trouble, but no one suspected who the
sorcerers were. Some time afterwards a man disappeared
and never came back. After this the people
were so much excited that they sent a messenger to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
celebrated 'medicine man' who was known all over the
country for his skill in discovering sorcerers. They
promised to pay him two slaves if he would come.
The name of this great 'ooganga,' or medicine man,
was Makoonga; he is living now. He sent word
by the messenger that he would come after his
return from another village where he was going to
find out who had killed by witchcraft the brother
of the chief.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="fired"><img src="images/i_046.png" width="500"
height="757" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>We raised our guns and aimed at the two biggest white-nosed
ones and fired.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>"There was great joy in the village when the messenger
brought back word that Makoonga was coming.
Three days after the return of the messenger
another man disappeared, and remains of his body
were discovered, showing that he had been devoured
by a leopard. Then all the people said that some
one among them had changed his shape and turned
into a leopard, that he had eaten up the three persons
who had disappeared, and had also taken the shape
of an elephant and trodden upon the man who had
been killed in that way.</p>

<p>"There was no more sleep in the village. The
people danced all night, and called upon the spirits
of their ancestors to protect them from witchcraft.
They made invocation to their idol and to the spirits
Mburu and Abambo.</p>

<p>"Then Makoonga came, and the following day the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
people met, and he drank the 'mboundou' before
them, and after drinking it he became possessed of
the power of divination, and told them that Igala
and Yienoo through witchcraft had taken the shape
of leopards and eaten up the three people, and that
Igala had taken the shape of an elephant and trampled
the man.</p>

<p>"There was a great uproar amongst the people when
they heard this. They went to the home of Igala
and Yienoo and brought them to the village. They
had to drink the 'mboundou' to prove their innocence
in the presence of all the people. Makoonga
made the potation, drank part of it first, and then
handed the bowl to Igala and Yienoo. They had
hardly tasted it when they fell on the ground. That
was the proof that they were guilty, and the people
surrounded them and cut their bodies into a hundred
pieces and then threw them into the river. Oh,
Oguizi," exclaimed Rogala, in concluding his story,
"often witchcraft comes into people without their
wishing it and against their will."</p>

<p>After this narrative he untied our canoe and we
continued our ascent of the river. After a long pull
he suddenly headed our canoe towards the shore, and
after passing under the branches of trees that almost
touched the water we came to a path which no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
coming up or down the river could detect. This
path led to Rogala's place. Ndova uttered grunt-like
sounds of satisfaction; Andekko barked to show his
joy. They knew they had come home; they were
well acquainted with this spot.</p>

<p class="i2">THE HOME OF ROGALA&mdash;HIS HUNTING-TROPHIES&mdash;A
WEIRD SPOT&mdash;ASPECT OF THE SURROUNDING FOREST&mdash;SHINSHOOKO
AND ALAPAI&mdash;LEOPARDS IN THE
NEIGHBORHOOD</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">After</span> a few minutes' walk we came to a grove
of plantain trees, and there saw the home of
Rogala, which was composed of four small structures.
The dwelling-house had a veranda in front. It
was built of bark with a roof thatched with palm
leaves, and was about eighteen feet long and twelve
wide. It had only one door.</p>

<p>Under the veranda hung the tails of nearly all the
elephants he had killed. I counted ninety-five of them.
Some of the tails he had got went to Chief Rotembo.
All along the roof were skulls of antelopes with the
graceful spiral horns, two skulls of male gorillas,
several skulls of nshiegos or chimpanzees, of wild
boars, of buffaloes, of leopards and other wild animals.</p>

<p>Four elephant skulls stood at each corner of the
house. These elephants had been killed near the
plantations. Rogala was the greatest elephant hunter
of his day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>One building was composed of a single roof merely,
under which cooking was done. Here also people
were received, and the space it covered was the
dining-room.</p>

<p>A small house near by was for Mburu, a spirit,
who sometimes came to rest there during the night.
His bed lay on the ground, and was composed of dry
leaves covered with a mat. His pillow was a smooth
round piece of wood. In the fourth small house
was the idol. There were also a chicken-coop and a
goat-house.</p>

<p>"We have chosen this spot," said Rogala, "because
at a certain time of the year the country is full of
elephants. They come to eat the leaves of a tree that
is more plentiful around here than in other parts of
the forest."</p>

<p>A little further on I saw several other small houses;
those belonged to Shinshooko and Alapai.</p>

<p>The place was entirely deserted, for all the people
had gone into the forest,&mdash;the men to cut trees for
new plantations, and the women to attend to the
crops that had been planted and bring back bunches
of plantain or cassava roots.</p>

<p>What a weird spot the hunters had chosen for their
home! The little houses of bark looked small indeed
compared with the tall trees that surrounded them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The plantain trees and the cassava grew in the
midst of branches of the trees that had been felled
and burned afterwards. Not far off was the river,
flowing in the midst of the dark silent forest, which
was only disturbed now and then by the shrill cries
of parrots, or the chatter of a troop of monkeys or
the tap of the woodpecker. In the forest surrounding
the houses hung huge lianas which looked like
gigantic swinging snakes. Some of the trees had
gorgeous flowers, and orchids grew on the bark of
many. The foliage was greatly diversified.</p>

<p>On the border of the clearing stood a gigantic elimi
tree; along its trunk came out a soft sticky whitish
gum, which the people use to make torches with. The
forest seemed to be made of three or four layers of
trees growing on the top of each other, while here
and there, towering above all, rose an immense one
that seemed to look down on the great forest from
its own lofty height. Under all the trees was the
thick jungle, in which roamed wild and often ferocious
beasts.</p>

<p>Rogala brought a stool and invited me to a seat
under the veranda of his house. Towards sunset
Rogala's wife returned with three boys, their children.
She carried an infant in a sling on her back. She
looked at me in fear and trembling, and she and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
children ran to hide. This annoyed Rogala very
much, and he called her back in an angry tone. Then
he became milder, and told her and the children not to
be afraid of his friend the Oguizi.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="hide"><img src="images/i_054.png" width="500"
height="768" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>She looked at me in fear and trembling, and she and
the children ran to hide.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>Soon after two men and their wives, loaded with two
large bunches of plantain, and their children made
their appearance. These men were Shinshooko and
Alapai.</p>

<p>Rogala bade them approach. Shinshooko was over
six feet two in height, very thin, and brown in color.
He came from a country called Ashango. Alapai
was short, thickset, and very black. He came from
a tribe called Apono. These two tribes had the
same language. Shinshooko and Alapai looked at
me constantly, but avoided the glance of my eyes,
of which they were afraid. But Rogala allayed their
fears by telling them that I was a good Oguizi and
a great friend of their master Rotembo, who sent
word by him that they must go and hunt with
me in the forest.</p>

<p>The three then went away to our canoe and brought
back my things with them. Shinshooko and Alapai
were eager to hear what had occurred since Rogala
had left them, and how it happened that I came
with him.</p>

<p>Rogala told all that had taken place, how his master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Rotembo had given him to me, that I was a great
hunter, and that I came to hunt with them.</p>

<p>Shinshooko and Alapai and their families listened
in profound silence to the wonderful story of Rogala,
and when he had finished it was the turn of Shinshooko
and Alapai to tell what had happened during
the absence of Rogala. Shinshooko was the speaker,
and began thus: "Leopards have made their appearance
in the neighborhood since you left, Rogala.
What has brought the leopards so suddenly into our
neighborhood we cannot tell, but it must be that the
bashikouay ants have invaded and scoured a great part
of the forest and driven them away, and they have fled
towards us. We have seen many tracks of their big
paws. We must look out for these leopards and
make traps and catch them and hunt them. Fortunately
our goat-house is so strong and so secure that
leopards cannot break through. But we must do all
we can to kill them, for fear that some one of them
might be a man-eater and devour some of us or some
of our children."</p>

<p>That night numerous fires were lighted to scare
away the leopards. I went into my little hut, but
kept awake with "Bulldog" by my side, for I thought
a leopard might easily come through the thin roof of
palm leaves over my head. We all hoped that there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
was no man-eater among the leopards, for if there were
we were sure that he would lie in wait for some one.
When once they have tasted human flesh, they like it
better than anything else. But no leopard paid us a
visit during the night.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="i2">WE BUILD A LEOPARD TRAP&mdash;A NIGHT ON THE
WATCH&mdash;THE BEAST APPEARS AT LAST&mdash;CAUGHT
IN THE TRAP AND SOON DESPATCHED&mdash;HER MATE
KILLED THE FOLLOWING NIGHT&mdash;EXCITEMENT OF
ANDEKKO AND NDOVA</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next morning the men went into the
forest to cut poles, and after we had a sufficient
number we built a trap to catch the leopard.</p>

<p>We constructed the trap in the following manner
according to the plan of Shinshooko, who had the
reputation of great skill and ingenuity in making all
sorts of traps.</p>

<p>We built with the poles a long narrow funnel-like
alley, which became gradually smaller and smaller
towards the end, so that it was impossible for the
leopard to go entirely through. At the entrance
Shinshooko constructed a trap-door which was to
fall after the leopard was fairly in. The end of this
funnel-like structure communicated with the goat-house,
which we surrounded with a double row of
poles, so that the leopard could not get through.
The roof was made entirely of poles strongly fastened
together. The structure was about twenty feet long.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>I said to Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai: "Tonight
I shall not sleep, but will watch for leopards
near the goat-house. Perhaps some of them will
come when they scent the goats; so do not be afraid
if you hear the detonation of a gun. I want all the
dogs to be shut up indoors."</p>

<p>When evening came, I took a nap, for I knew that
it was the habit of the leopards not to prowl before
midnight, unless famished.</p>

<p>Towards eleven o'clock I awoke, and then made
ready for the leopards. I took up a position opposite
the goat-house under the veranda of a little house,
where I was partly hidden from view. I surrounded
myself with branches of trees I had gathered during
the day. There I waited.</p>

<p>The moon, that was on the wane, rose and threw a
dim light all around. It was an ideal night for lying
in wait for a leopard.</p>

<p>One o'clock came and no leopard had made his appearance.
Time went on slowly. Two o'clock, no
leopard. I began to think that they would not call,
when suddenly the goats began to bleat. They had
scented the approach of a beast of prey and become
terrified. Suddenly I saw from behind one of the
houses and among three or four plantain trees something
moving. It was the leopard. He was coming.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
His eyes shone as if they were burning coals. Then
slowly he advanced towards the trap. I did not
wonder that Rogala had admonished me to make no
noise. The leopard was slowly crawling near, his
belly almost touching the ground.</p>

<p>I watched him carefully to see what he was going to
do. His long tail beat his flanks. He sniffed at the
goat, and finding that he could not reach the frightened
creature, he went round the trap. I watched
with breathless attention.</p>

<p>Then he came to the opening, and entered. Soon
after I heard the trap-door close behind him. That
did not disturb him, for all he thought of was the goat.
He went on until he got so jammed in that he could
not advance further. Then he became excited as he
tried to extricate himself, and roared with anger. He
could not turn back, and I fired and killed him.</p>

<p>In an instant Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai
were out of their cabins, guns in hand, running towards
the goat-house. We lighted torches to frighten
other leopards, and came out with them. The men
gave a terrific war-cry, and shouted: "Leopard, you
will not eat more of our goats!" In a short time
everybody was around the leopard, looking at him.</p>

<p>I opened his mouth and looked at his terrible-looking
canines. "These four canines," I said, "I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
will send to Rotembo. I hope we shall kill leopards
enough to have canines for a big necklace
for him."</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="near"><img src="images/i_062.png" width="550"
height="321" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>The leopard was slowly crawling near.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>"Yes," they all shouted, "let us kill all the leopards
in the country."</p>

<p>Then all the people danced around the leopard,
singing at the same time: "You wicked leopard, your
days are over, you will not make any one now fear
you. The antelopes and gazelles of the forest would
be glad if they knew that you have been killed by the
great Oguizi."</p>

<p>The dance lasted until daylight, when we skinned
the beast. "Let us make a belt of his skin for Chief
Rotembo," I said; and we accordingly did so. The
tail I gave to Rogala. We divided the liver into
several parts.</p>

<p>Later in the day Rogala, Shinshooko, and I went
into the forest with Andekko in search of the lair
of the leopard, which was a female, hoping to take
the young ones. But we were not successful, and
were obliged finally to return without accomplishing
our object.</p>

<p>"When night comes," I said to my hunters, "I
will lie in wait for the male leopard; perhaps he will
come here in search of his mate."</p>

<p>To this the man replied: "Yes, a male leopard is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
more likely to come and seek for his mate than a
female is."</p>

<p>That night as I was watching I suddenly saw a dark
spot moving not far from where I stood. Suddenly I
saw the eyes of a leopard looking like burning coals.
He had come to look for his mate. But he had not
advanced far towards the houses when I fired and
killed him.</p>

<p>Andekko, who had been fastened inside Rogala's
house, was let loose and came bounding towards us.
He had heard the sound of the gun, and knew that
something was up. At the sight of the dead leopard
his hair stood straight up, and then before we knew it
he was on the body of the beast with his teeth fastened
in its throat.</p>

<p>In the morning I said to Rogala, "Bring Ndova to
look at the leopard." He went after the monkey and
soon came back with Ndova in his arms. At the sight
of the leopard Ndova sprang from Rogala's arms, and
in an instant was up a young tree, the hair all over his
body standing upright. He glared at the dead leopard,
uttering at the same time sounds of rage. We
could not make him come down from the tree until
we had taken away the leopard from the place. Then
he descended and hid away in the house of Rogala.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">After</span> a few days of constant companionship
with Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai, their
fears of me had been allayed and we had become great
friends.</p>

<p>The women had also become accustomed to me and
had grown to like me, for I had given them beads,
looking-glasses, and some other trinkets. They also
showed much pleasure when they brought to my feet
bunches of plantain, peanuts, or other food. They
would fish in the river, and all the fish they caught
they would bring to me, so that I might choose what
I wanted. The children would snare birds and bring
them to me. They were always delighted to follow
me when I went out to shoot birds.</p>

<p>Andekko and Ndova, who were always fed by me,
had also become accustomed to the color of my face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
and my long hair; they knew I was their friend, for
when they were hungry I gave them food.</p>

<p>Ndova from his perch always watched for my return,
and when he saw me he uttered peculiar sounds of
joy, which were always the same, so that when he
uttered them I always knew that he was glad. He
knew that I generally brought to him nuts, berries, or
fruits which he liked. When I was eating with Rogala,
Shinshooko, and Alapai, Andekko was always by me,
for he had learned that he fared much better by my
side, as I had directed them not to feed him.</p>

<p>One day I said to Rogala: "Meat is getting scarce.
Let us take Ndova with us into the forest to-morrow
morning; perhaps he will succeed, if we meet monkeys
belonging to his species, in making them come to him.
Then, if we kill two or three, we shall have monkey
meat to eat."</p>

<p>The following morning Rogala, with Ndova tied by
a rope, and I set out for the forest. Once in a while
Ndova would call for his friends, the monkeys of his
species; but there came no answer to his call,&mdash;there
were no ndovas in that part of the forest.</p>

<p>We kept on further and further; but though Ndova
called for those of his species, there came no answer
back, and finally we deemed it time to return home,
as otherwise we should have to sleep in the forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>On our way back Ndova began to chatter in his own
language. What he meant we of course could not tell
at first, but soon we found out that through some peculiar
gifts only belonging to monkeys, perhaps with
his keen sense of smell, he knew that there were
monkeys of his own tribe near. His voice or utterances
were answered by other sounds made by a troop
of monkeys which Rogala and I knew to be ndovas,
and before we realized their presence, they were all
upon a tree above our heads. Ndova became dreadfully
excited. I took aim at the biggest monkey,
fired, and he fell on the ground with a great crash.
The others gave a cry of alarm, and in less than
twenty seconds were out of sight.</p>

<p>The next day I said to Rogala: "Let us go into
the forest with Andekko. I want to see how he hunts,
and if he drives the game within gunshot of the place
where we are waiting for it."</p>

<p>"He will surely do that," replied Rogala.</p>

<p>The next morning, at dawn of day, we started for
the forest, Andekko ahead of us. Suddenly he disappeared.
Once in a while Rogala shouted to let the
dog know where we stood. Then we waited and
waited, Rogala now and then calling Andekko at the
top of his voice. After a few hours we heard the
barking of Andekko. The barking became louder, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Rogala said: "Oguizi, let us make ready, for Andekko
is probably driving an antelope towards us."</p>

<p>In another instant a large antelope with long spiral
horns passed near us, but not near enough for us to
fire. Then the barking of Andekko died away in the
distance, and Rogala said: "We must not go away.
I think Andekko will bring back the antelope towards
us." He was not mistaken. A short time afterwards
we heard Andekko again in the distance; the barking
became louder and louder, and at last seemed very near.
An antelope came bounding by us. We fired and
brought him down.</p>

<p>We returned home with our spoil, and the following
afternoon I said to Rogala: "Where is Andekko? I
have not seen him to-day. Has he perhaps been devoured
by a prowling leopard?"</p>

<p>Rogala smiled at my question, and replied: "Andekko
is a wide-awake dog, and seeing that we did not
go into the forest with him, he has gone to hunt by
himself, and I should not wonder if we heard his barking
soon, telling us that he is pursuing game towards our
little settlement and warning us to be ready for it."</p>

<p>Rogala was right; a short time afterwards we heard
the barking of Andekko. He was running after some
animal and giving us warning. But the barking soon
became fainter, then could not be heard at all.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="down"><img src="images/i_070.png" width="550"
height="335" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>We fired and brought him down</i>."
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I said to Rogala, "The animal has escaped from
Andekko."</p>

<p>"It is perhaps so," he replied; "but the dog will
not give up the chase so easily."</p>

<p>A little while after we heard Andekko again far
away; then the barking gradually became louder.
We got ready with our guns. I had my smooth-bore
loaded with buckshot. Soon after a gazelle passed by
us, closely pursued by Andekko. We fired and killed
the beautiful creature. We had great trouble in preventing
Andekko from tearing the animal in pieces
until I cut off the foreleg and threw it to him, exclaiming:
"Great indeed is the gift of Chief Rotembo
to me. We shall not starve while Andekko is with us."</p>

<p>The following day we went again with Andekko
into the forest. This time Shinshooko, Alapai, and
Rogala were all with me. They had seen footmarks
of a gorilla and of her baby. So we took a net with
us to throw over the little one and capture him in case
we succeeded in killing the mother.</p>

<p>After a tramp of three hours we heard the fierce
barking of Andekko on the right of the path, not very
far from us. There followed loud, short yells of an
ngina. We immediately left the path and entered the
forest, being guided by the barking of Andekko and
the yells of the ngina. We soon found ourselves in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the presence of a mamma ngina on a tree, with a tiny
baby holding to her and uttering sounds of fright.
Andekko was in a perfect rage; his hair stood up,
bristling like the quills of a porcupine.</p>

<p>Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai were by my side.
The ngina was looking fiercely at us. Her big black
face, wrinkled all over, was savagely wicked. The
little fellow was hiding his face against her breast.
She uttered sharp, piercing yells of anger, then a shout
of "Whoa, whoa." I aimed at her, and fired. She
dropped, but held on for an instant to the branch upon
which she was seated with a firm hand, while the little
one clung fast to her shoulders. Then she let go and
fell down some twenty feet to the ground with a great
crash. She was dead, and before we had time to
rescue the little ngina, Andekko had strangled him, to
my infinite sorrow.</p>

<p>Rogala and Shinshooko said: "We must look out for
her mate; the big 'man ngina' may come upon us in
a moment. Perhaps he is already coming silently to
her rescue."</p>

<p>We were glad we had Andekko with us, for we were
sure to be warned by him of the approach of the big
beast. We cut off the heads of the ngina and of the
little one as trophies, and then retraced our steps
towards Rogala's and Shinshooko's home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>On our way back we heard, several miles away, the
mighty voice of the male ngina calling upon his mate
to let her know where he was; but no answer came
back to him, and I found myself wondering what his
feelings would be when he came to where she had
been killed. We would have gone after him, but it
was too late in the day.</p>

<p>There was great excitement on our return. The
following day Rogala warned me to take no other gun
but "Bulldog" if I went into the forest, saying: "The
'man ngina' is probably around looking for the slayer
of his wife." How I wished I could have been present
when the big beast came before the dead body of his
mate and saw her and her baby ngina headless!
How he must have yelled and roared! How fiercely
he would have come to the attack if some one had
been near! How I wished I could face him with
"Bulldog" in my hand! We expected to hear his
roar that day, then go after him; but the forest was
silent. He had gone wandering in search of another
mate.</p>

<p>The next day we heard Andekko barking in the
forest not very far off. He seemed to bark at the
same spot all the time, and Rogala said: "Let us go
where he is and find out what is the matter."</p>

<p>So we went towards the spot where he was bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>ing,
and at last came to it. No wonder he remained
in the same place. He was barking at a porcupine,
that had rolled himself into a ball and had all his
quills standing erect.</p>

<p>Andekko was in a perfect rage, his hair was erect on
his back, but I knew that it was impossible for him to
bite the porcupine, and he feared his terrible quills.
He would not leave the porcupine until we called him
away, and the porcupine as long as Andekko was near
him kept his quills erect.</p>

<p>Andekko disappeared again the following morning.
In the evening he returned with a scar on his back
and with a bloody muzzle. He had had an encounter
with some wild animal. Evidently some sharp teeth
had bitten him. But in the end he had had the best
of the conflict, as his muzzle testified; it was clear he
had fed on his victim.</p>

<p>Rogala put some balsam on his wounds. The dog
was manifestly very tired, for in a short time he was
stretched full length near the fire, and after a while he
was dreaming. His legs moved as if he were running,
and he barked softly. The following morning
Andekko was nowhere to be seen. The punishment
he had received the day before had not scared him in
the least. He had gone hunting again.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I loved</span> to walk by myself in the great forest,
taking my smooth-bore gun for birds, with which
I always took a few bullets in case I should meet
some large animals.</p>

<p>One day as I walked along looking at the butterflies
that were very plentiful on both sides of the path, I
thought I heard, at some distance, a noise among the
trees ahead as if monkeys were feeding. Cautiously
I went in the direction of the noise. I had to leave
the path and go through the jungle. I had to walk
slowly, with my body bent, in order to be hidden from
the monkeys and not to frighten them.</p>

<p>When I got near the trees, I found that they were
nkagos feeding and uttering grunts of satisfaction, so
pleased were they. I could recognize the leader of
the troop on the lookout. Suddenly he gave a peculiar
cry or sound. The nkagos became very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
excited. Their hair became erect on their backs; the
sounds or words they uttered were quick and showed
anger. They seemed as if getting ready for a fight.</p>

<p>What was the cause of this sudden change in their
conduct? I asked myself. I was soon to know. I
heard in the distance a noise as if a troop of monkeys
were coming in our direction, the noise made by the
bending of the branches as the monkeys leaped from
one to another. It became louder and louder.</p>

<p>Soon this noise was responded to by the loud cries
of the troop of nkagos near me. The monkeys that
were approaching answered them, and I recognized
their cries to be those of the mondis. They knew
the tree and had come to feed upon its fruits. They
were too late. The best had been eaten by the
nkagos, who also knew the time when the fruits were
to be ripe and had come ahead of the mondis.</p>

<p>The mondis were furious, and advanced boldly
towards the tree, led by their old and trusted chiefs.
The nkagos had made up their minds to fight and
finish the repast they had begun. They had not
yet filled their pouches. The mondis jumped on
the tree, and a fight ensued among all the monkeys.
There were terrible shrieks and some pretty hard
bitings. The nkagos were getting the worst of the
fight, when I raised my gun, aiming at a mondi that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
had just finished a fight with a nkago. Bang went
my gun. There were general cries of fright among
the mondis and the nkagos, and both sides fled with
the greatest precipitation, each troop, however, going
in a different direction.</p>

<p>In the meantime the mondi I had fired at had
fallen to the ground with a great crash, dead. It was
a very fine big one, covered with long black glossy
hair as it was. I thought I would remain hidden and
see if the monkeys would come back.</p>

<p>After about two hours I heard a noise through the
branches. I looked up and saw a solitary mondi.
He uttered a cry of distress, calling upon his mate
that had been killed.</p>

<p>Spying her dead body lying on the ground, he
came to her, and uttered low mutterings of distress as
he saw that she was dead. I shouted, and he fled.
I carried the dead mondi to our camp, and as it
weighed I judged about forty pounds, I was glad
when I arrived and laid it on the ground.</p>

<p>Several days after this, being in the forest but not
far away from the camp, I saw a leopard running
quickly in front of me with one of her cubs in her
mouth. I wondered at this, for it was so unusual
to see a leopard out of her lair in the daytime. She
was evidently taking her cubs away for some reason.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
I had not walked a hundred feet further when I saw
the leopard's mate running in front of me with a cub
in his mouth also.</p>

<p>I wondered again why the leopards were moving
away from their lair. I soon found out. Other
animals, and even snakes, were all fleeing in the same
direction as the leopards. This, and the flight of
insects themselves, told me that an army of bashikouay
ants was advancing, attacking every living
thing before them. I ran towards the plantation as
fast as I could.</p>

<p>Soon Andekko, who had gone into the forest by
himself, made his appearance. He was perfectly wild.
The poor dog was crying, moaning, and rolling himself
on the ground to scratch his body, on which were
numbers of the ants biting him. During the night
we were awakened by the bites of the advance guard
of the bashikouays. They were in our houses. There
was a great commotion among the mice, rats, and cockroaches.
They were surrounded by the bashikouays.
Wherever they fled, there were the bashikouays to
attack them. The scorpions, centipedes, and spiders
could not help themselves, and were eaten up in a
short time.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all the inhabitants of the plantation
were up and out of their houses, the babies in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
arms of their mothers. Numerous fires were lighted
everywhere. Boiling water and hot ashes were thrown
upon the ants and we put brands across their paths.</p>

<p>It took us the rest of the night to drive them
away and disorganize them. We had killed hundreds
of thousands of them. The men could not
find words bad enough for the bashikouays. "Oh,"
said Shinshooko, "these horrid bashikouays will
drive all the game away, and it will be a long time
before it will return."</p>

IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD&mdash;WE GO AFTER THEM
AND KILL TWO.</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Rogala's</span> wife had a beautiful gray parrot with
a bright red tail. The parrot could talk well
and say many things. Every morning he would perch
on a tree and call upon the flocks of parrots that were
flying in every direction in search of food. Once in
a while a flock of these parrots, attracted by his cries
or rather speech to them, would come and alight close
by, and they would hold a conversation together for
quite a while. Poor Ngozo&mdash;such was his name&mdash;seemed
then to regret much that his wings were
clipped, for he wanted to go and fly with his wild
comrades. One day I said to myself: "Andekko
drives game to me; Ndova brings monkeys and finds
fruits. Suppose I use Ngozo as a decoy. Old
parrots are about as tough birds as one can taste,
but young ones taste like pigeons."</p>

<p>So one morning I lay under a tree waiting for
parrots to come. A few flocks passed over us, utter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>ing
peculiar sounds. What these meant I could not
tell, but they were afraid to alight. Evidently they
did not like the look of the house.</p>

<p>At some distance from Rogala's house near a grove
of plantain trees was a tree bearing a red fruit which
I knew parrots liked very much. I told Rogala to
carry his wife's parrot under that tree and I would
lie in wait there. So Ngozo was taken there by
his master, and he began to talk.</p>

<p>Soon I heard above our heads a flock of parrots.
They came down upon our tree and began to talk
to our parrot and feed. When I saw three or four
in such a position as to enable me to kill them all,
I fired, and they fell, and the others, shrieking with all
their might, flew away in affright.</p>

<p>I went after the parrots, which had deep yellow
rings round their eyes. I saw that they were very
old, but nevertheless I was glad, for I would have
some meat to eat. I broiled one on charcoal. When
he was cooked, he was so tough that I thought he
must be over one hundred years old. It seemed as
if I were biting an old piece of India rubber or a piece
of leather.</p>

<p>In the evening, thinking that the others were as tough
as their companions, I boiled them, and I thought that
I was going to have a good parrot soup. The soup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
was not bad, but the parrots were so tough that I gave
up trying to eat them.</p>

<p>The following morning we again put the parrot
under the tree, and a flock alighted in the same way,
and I succeeded in killing two of them.</p>

<p>In the afternoon another flock alighted also, and I
killed two more. But after this no parrots came near
us, though a number of flocks flew over our tree and
Ngozo called to them.</p>

<p>All the flocks of parrots meet every evening, and
the flocks that had been fired at had warned their
fellow ngozos of their danger and to take good care
not to alight on that tree.</p>

<p>After this the flocks of parrots, as they passed above
or near us, took care to fly high, uttering shrill cries
of anger.</p>

<p>One day while I was stuffing some birds I had
killed in the morning, and Rogala was looking at the
work I was doing with great astonishment, Shinshooko
made his appearance. He was out of breath, for he
had been running fast. As he saw us, he shouted:
"Jockoo! Jockoo! Elephants! Elephants!"</p>

<p>"Where are they?" Rogala and I inquired at the
same time.</p>

<p>"Not far from here," he said, speaking with difficulty,
for he was much out of breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>We took our guns, I taking "Bulldog" with me.
We had hardly walked an hour in the path, when we
came upon numerous elephant tracks.</p>

<p>"They have gone towards the river," whispered
Shinshooko, as he looked in the direction in which
their footprints pointed.</p>

<p>When we came to the river, we saw the canoe with
several paddles. It did not take us long to embark,
and we paddled so noiselessly down the stream that
our paddles could not be heard as they struck the
water. Before coming to a bend which commanded
the view of the river for a long distance, we landed
to search further down. Shinshooko went to the
extreme end of the point, where a better view could
be obtained. In a short time he returned. I could
see by his face that he had good news to tell us. He
had seen the elephants.</p>

<p>We followed the left bank of the river, and came to
a place where we saw a herd of elephants standing
close together. Foremost was a large bull elephant,
their leader. I counted twenty-seven elephants. Their
big ears were moving continually, and their trunks
were swinging up and down. They were trumpeting
and squealing. Some were very large. The bull
seemed to be about ten and a half feet in height, some
of the cows nine and a half feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the bull made for the river. The others
followed, and soon they had a grand time together in
the water.</p>

<p>After watching them awhile, Rogala and Shinshooko
whispered: "Oguizi, we must follow the river
through the woods and get opposite the elephants."
We walked through the jungle most carefully in order
not to attract their attention. Fortunately they were
having such a noisy time that they could not hear us.
Nor could they scent us, as the wind was in our favor.
When we surmised from the noise they made in the
water that we were opposite them, we made for the
banks of the river. Finally we got a glimpse of
the elephants and crept to the water edge. The bank
of the river here was high and abrupt, so the elephants
could not charge us. I was very glad of this, for I
never felt comfortable when the huge beast was bearing
down upon me. It had been agreed beforehand that
each one of us should pick out an elephant and that
we should fire at the same time.</p>

<p>The elephants, unaware of our presence, were swimming
without any suspicion of danger. All at once
the huge bull turned and swam towards us. There
was no way to kill him but by a forehead shot, that is,
shooting him between the eyes. The steel-pointed
bullets of "Bulldog" could do the work well. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
number of cow elephants turned also towards us. I
pointed out to Rogala and Shinshooko two of them
that could be shot near the temple or behind the ears,
and made them a sign that I was going to take a shot
at the bull.</p>

<div class="caption">
"<i>Suddenly the bull made for the river</i>."
</div></div>

<p>We raised our guns. I looked at Rogala and Shinshooko.
They were looking at me also. We took
careful aim and I gave three clicks; the third one was
the signal to fire. Bang, bang, bang, went our guns at
the same time. I thought the guns of my men had
burst, so loud was the detonation. I saw only a dense
smoke, which hid them for a while from me.</p>

<p>Looking at the water, I saw the bull elephant raise
and lower his trunk twice; then he swam towards
our bank, which was so steep that he could not land.
He was evidently badly wounded. Suddenly the water
around him became a mass of foam. He was in his
last struggle. The current took him down stream.
The two cow elephants were badly wounded and seemed
dazed, but they succeeded in reaching the shore.</p>

<p>In the meantime, at the noise of the guns, the herd
took to the shore and fled through the forest, tearing
down and trampling everything in the jungle
that obstructed their flight.</p>

<p>We went for our canoe, and after descending the river
we saw the big bull elephant stranded. What a huge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
beast he was! He had two enormous tusks, but, as was
always the case, they were not of the same length and
weight.</p>

<p>We left the bull, and went into the forest in search
of the two cow elephants, for Rogala and Shinshooko
were sure that they had wounded them and that they
had probably died in the forest not far from the place
where they were shot.</p>

<p>We had landed where we had seen them leave the
river, and saw some blood on the ground. Following
their tracks, we came to a dead cow elephant.</p>

<p>"Let us go after the other one," said the two men.</p>

<p>In the meantime they had reloaded their guns. We
followed the track the other cow elephant had left behind.
After a short time we came up with her, seated
apparently on her knees. As soon as she saw us she
got up to charge, but she had not gone five steps when
she fell dead.</p>

<p>Then we went back to the plantation, and the
following day all, including the women, returned
with axes and baskets to get the tusks, and as much
of the meat as we could.</p>

<p>The huge tusks of the bull were imbedded in his
head over thirty-one inches, so there were only about
four feet of the tusk outside. He was ten feet in
height, and had fine big ears. The hair on his tail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
was long and coarse. One of his tusks weighed sixty-nine
pounds, the other sixty-two. The tusks of the
cow elephants were smaller, the biggest not weighing
more than twenty-nine pounds.</p>

<p>Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai danced round the
elephants and cut their tails off, to add to the number
they had. Then we made for the plantation with
all the meat our canoes could carry. A big platform
was built to smoke the meat. We fed on elephant
meat for a time, but it was far from being as good as
monkey flesh.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="i2">WE BUILD A FORTIFIED CAMP IN THE DEPTHS OF
THE FOREST&mdash;STRUCTURE OF THE CAMP&mdash;LAYING
IN STORES OF PROVISIONS&mdash;KOOLA NUTS&mdash;SOURCE
OF MY INFLUENCE OVER THE NATIVES</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> evening as Rogala, Shinshooko, Alapai, and
I were seated around a blazing fire, we talked
about gorillas, elephants, and other big game, and
determined to go and build an "olako" camp in the
deep and gloomy recesses of the forest, taking with us
Andekko and Ndova.</p>

<p>The following day the women put a large quantity
of cassava roots or manioc in the stream running
near Rogala's house; these were to remain in the water
three days, after which they were to be cut, pounded,
cooked, and made into cakes.</p>

<p>I was short of soap; so my hunters collected a
quantity of palm nuts, the kind from which palm oil
is made. These nuts we boiled until the pulp became
quite soft. Then the women pounded the nuts
in wooden mortars, and the pulp furnished the oil.
I then gathered all the ashes from the fires, boiled
these for a long time, then leaving the ashes at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
bottom of the vessel, took the water and boiled it
with a certain amount of palm oil. By this process I
made soft soap.</p>

<p>I had to wash my own clothes, for not only did the
people not know how, but in one sense did not know
what clean linen was. They could not tell whether
my clothes were soiled or not. I did not wonder,
seeing the way they made their toilet. After taking
a bath, they rubbed their bodies with oil mixed with
clay, or with oil mixed with the powder of odoriferous
woods. This was what they called making themselves
clean.</p>

<p>The wives of the men and the children were to go
with us to help carry the food to our camp; and
when the day of our departure arrived, three canoes
were loaded with food, bunches of plantain, and our
outfit.</p>

<p>We had four axes with us, queer-looking ones,
several machetes, two sharpening stones, and ammunition;
above all, my "precious box" with its invaluable
instruments.</p>

<p>Our party divided and went in different canoes.</p>

<p>After ascending the river for a few hours, we
stopped by a path which had led formerly to the
village of Rotembo's slaves. There we camped, landing
our outfit. A few miles further navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stopped. We lighted many fires, and the men collected
branches of trees for me to sleep upon.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we got ready to start. We
followed in single file the footpath&mdash;which was almost
obliterated, for it was seldom used now except for
hunting&mdash;and passed through former plantations of
plantain and cassava, now covered with a dense impenetrable
jungle, far worse than any part of the
forest.</p>

<p>The walking was very tedious, for since the path
had been used but seldom, numerous trees or their
branches had fallen across it. We halted a little
after midday to rest and to eat near a lonely crystal-like
little rivulet from which we could get delicious
water to drink. Then we continued our way until
almost sunset.</p>

<p>Rogala, who was leading, suddenly stopped, and I
followed his example. The rest of the party, who
were behind, gradually came up with us one by one.
Then the men said: "Here, Oguizi, we are to build
our camp," pointing to a little spring bubbling out
of the ground.</p>

<p>I said to myself: "We need not bother about
water if we are besieged in our camp, for the spring
will be within our enclosure."</p>

<p>We slept under the trees, and the next morning we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
were all at work getting material for our camp. The
men went to cut poles; the women carried them to
the camping-ground, or went after leaves to be
twisted into ropes.</p>

<p>The cutting of long poles was the most laborious
work, for a great many were required. The axes had
to be sharpened many times. But after much hard toil
we succeeded in making a fortified encampment forty
feet square, with the spring in one of the corners.</p>

<p>After that we built separate shelters for every one
of those who were to remain behind, to sleep under;
then a little house made entirely of sticks close together
for Ndova, in which we were to shut him when
we went into the forest without him, so that he might
be protected from snakes, or birds of prey, such as
eagles, or carnivorous animals. Then we made two
ladders with lianas. They were almost as flexible as
if they had been ropes made of hemp. One was to
hang inside and the other outside. I made two
shelters to keep our powder in, for I did not want to
have the whole of it in one place in case of fire. We
cut all kinds of briars, thorn-bushes, big aloes, and
small branches of trees, and put them outside the
fence for quite a distance, so that if any one came
through them, no matter how careful he might be, we
should hear them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>In the centre of our encampment was a tree from
which we could look over the fence, and we left uncut
two thick bushes in which we could hide.</p>

<p>I said to Rogala: "My 'precious box' must not remain
on the ground, for the white ants (nchelaylays)
are sure to eat the wood at the bottom and penetrate
within. So we will hang it to a branch of a young
tree, where it will be safe, for, as you know, the white
ants never ascend a green tree-trunk."</p>

<p>There was a koola tree close to our encampment,
and we collected the nuts that had fallen. These
were to be kept in reserve, and were to be eaten only
in case of starvation and not otherwise. For I did
not know what might happen; fierce natives might
find us out, and lie in wait for us and besiege us.</p>

<p>"Woe to any one who attacks us," I exclaimed to
my men.</p>

<p>"Yes," shouted Rogala, his eyes shining with
fierceness, "woe to them, for the Oguizi will show
them how he fights."</p>

<p>It was good for me that these wild men thought I
was endowed with extraordinary power. I never told
them I was an Oguizi, or spirit, but I never told them
I was not. My safety depended entirely on their
superstitious regard for me. If it had not been so,
and if they had thought I was a man like themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
I should not have lived to tell the tale of my
wanderings.</p>

<p>After five days of hard work our encampment was
finished. By that time almost all our plantains had
been eaten up, but we had all the cassava, and the cakes
of it would last us a goodly number of days.</p>

<p>The women and the children now thought of returning
home. We followed them as far as the river. They
were soon in their canoes, taking only two with them.
The other was left for us to use on our return. We
bade them good-bye, and soon they were out of sight.
Then we hid our canoe in the forest.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="i2">I TAKE A SWIM IN A CRYSTAL POOL&mdash;DRIVEN OUT
BY A HUGE SNAKE&mdash;I KILL THE SNAKE&mdash;CAMP-FIRE
TALK&mdash;HOW TO HUNT&mdash;IMPORTANCE OF
SILENCE AND NOISELESS MOVEMENTS</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">After</span> the departure of the women and children
my hunters busied themselves in making traps to
catch animals. I discovered not far from our camp a
beautiful rivulet of clear water, which had a little waterfall,
below which was a deep pool and a very good
place for a swim. On my return to the camp I told
Rogala of my discovery. He replied: "Oguizi, look
out for snakes when you bathe, for there are several
kinds of snakes that are very fond of being in the water.
Some of these are very poisonous."</p>

<p>"I will look out sharply for them, Rogala. They
can be easily seen, as the water is so clear," I replied.</p>

<p>Then I took a shot-gun with me, with a few bullets for
emergency, in case of a large animal making its appearance
suddenly, and left the camp for a swim, Rogala
recommending me once more to look out for snakes.</p>

<p>When I came to the stream, I hung my clothes on
the branch of a tree, put my gun near the water so that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I could seize it in an instant if necessary, and two
bullets by its side.</p>

<p>I went first under the waterfall. It was very refreshing,
for not a breath of air could be felt. Then
I looked in the pool. No snake was there, but
just as I was ready to take a plunge I saw a big
one creeping along the ground. I had hardly time
to look at the reptile before it was in the water.
The ugly creature was black, and yellow under the
stomach&mdash;his head was triangular, thus showing that
he was venomous&mdash;and about ten feet in length.
The water did not appear to me nice any more. I
rushed after my gun, then looked at the snake, which
was swimming very fast and had the same motion as
an eel. I dressed myself quickly, then, gun in hand,
I watched for him to swim to the surface of the
water. I had not to wait long before he appeared,
when I fired the load of small shot, broke his back,
and the reptile sank to the bottom.</p>

<p>Soon after I saw Rogala through the jungle coming
towards me. He had heard the report of the gun, and
came to see if I had killed anything. I pointed to the
bottom of the pool. When he saw the snake, a broad
grin of delight came over his face and he said: "The
snake is big and fat, and we shall have plenty to eat."
He cut a long, slender, cane-like tree, and succeeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with it in dragging the snake ashore. Then we returned
to the camp.</p>

<p>Soon after a large piece of the snake was boiling, and
Rogala was to have snake broth. I gave him a little
salt to mix with it, to his great delight. When very
hungry and having nothing else to eat, I often had to
be contented with a meal of snake, but that day I had
something else to eat.</p>

<p>In the evening, as we were seated by a bright fire that
illumined our camp, my men filled their pipes with
tobacco, lighted them, and after a few puffs Rogala
broke the silence, and said: "Oguizi, while we are
hunting in the forest we must not talk, but call each
other's attention by a 'click, click,' which means with
us poor black men to be on the lookout, to listen, as
we must be very sly, like wild beasts, and walk as
noiselessly as a leopard in search of prey. As we
walk along, our eyes must be everywhere, our ears must
listen. Unfortunately men have only two eyes; it is
a pity they have not two other eyes at the back of their
heads. Often men hide themselves behind a tree, and
when you have passed they throw a spear at you.
Hungry leopards often watch at the dusk of the day
by the springs where women get their water and then
leap upon them. But above all, let us try to be as
noiseless when we go through the jungle as a fish
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
swimming through the water. No man can hear a
fish swim."</p>

</div></div>

<p>"It is so," shouted Shinshooko and Alapai, in
approval of what Rogala had said.</p>

<p>Then we thought it was time to go to sleep. As I
looked round, I saw that Ndova was asleep with his
head hanging down, and that Andekko was stretched
at full length by one of the fires that were burning
round our shelters.</p>

GRADUALLY DRAW NEAR TO EACH OTHER AND TO
US&mdash;THEY MEET AND WE SLEEP IN THE FOREST&mdash;SUDDEN
APPEARANCE OF THE MALE NGINA&mdash;KILLING
OF THE NGINA AND HIS MATE</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> were up early, and had all slept well. After
our breakfast we started, but before doing so
we hid our ladder and also an axe as a precaution in
case our abode should be discovered and our ladder
stolen.</p>

<p>Shinshooko and Alapai were to visit the traps to
see if any game had been caught. Rogala and I were
to reconnoitre and see where the game was to be found.
Ndova and Andekko remained in the camp.</p>

<p>We had been gone about two hours, and had seen
several footprints of gorillas; so we knew that they
were in the neighborhood. Suddenly Rogala stopped,
and said in a whisper: "Oguizi, listen."</p>

<p>His quick ear had heard a noise far, far away. I
listened, and soon heard what I thought was the reverberation
of thunder among the hills. The noise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
seemed to be on our right. Rogala listened attentively,
and then whispered "Ngina" (gorilla). The
noise was made by a gorilla and was renewed from
time to time.</p>

<p>While listening, Rogala's quick sense of hearing
caught another noise in the far distance, this time on
the left, somewhat similar to the one on the right.
He listened attentively and then said, "Ngina." It
was another ngina, who was answering the talk of
her mate.</p>

<p>Then he whispered to me: "Oguizi, there are two
nginas talking to each other, the one on our right is
the man ngina, the one on our left is the woman ngina,
and she answers him."</p>

<p>They were a few miles from each other, and we were
about midway between the two. We followed the
path which seemed to be half-way between them,
looking at our guns carefully in order to be ready for
any emergency.</p>

<p>As we walked, we could hear them talk to each
other, one answering after the other stopped. It was
a real ngina conversation. I could detect the different
intonations.</p>

<p>We walked several miles, all the time hearing the
two gorillas continuously talking to each other. Rogala
said to me: "There is not food enough for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
two together, so they have separated in order that
each may have enough to eat."</p>

<p>After a while their voices came nearer and nearer,
and our position became, I thought, dangerous.</p>

<p>Rogala said in a very low tone: "The nginas are
going to meet before night; for they will sleep very
near together."</p>

<p>Louder and louder their guttural roar-like sounds
came. At last they seemed to be abreast of us, one
on either side. I asked Rogala in a very low tone:
"Have the nginas scented us?"</p>

<p>"No," he replied in a whisper; "they are talking
to each other, and will gradually meet as they come
along picking berries and fruits. The nginas can
see wonderfully well through the jungle. So let us
stand perfectly still.</p>

<p>"The female ngina always runs away," continued
Rogala. "It is the male ngina that fights, but both
are afraid of noise, and when they hear it they go in
an opposite direction. It is only when the male is
suddenly surprised by the appearance of a man that
he attacks him, or when he is tired of being followed
or tracked. Then he makes a stand. Then it is a
fight for life."</p>

<p>There was no mistake. The nginas were abreast
of us, and we were not more than half a mile from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
each. But soon the voices or sounds gradually seemed
to be ahead of us and became more and more distant.
They had passed us.</p>

<p>"After they meet," said Rogala, "the female ngina,
as it is getting late, will go up a tree to sleep with her
baby if she has one, and the big fellow will sleep
at the foot of the tree, his back resting against its
trunk, and there keep watch. We will sleep in the
forest to-night. We have koola nuts in our bags,
and we will eat these for our evening and morning
meals, and we will go after the nginas to-morrow
at daybreak."</p>

<p>The nginas' tremendous voices gradually died away,
till one might have thought it was the dying reverberation
in the far distance of claps of thunder.</p>

<p>We slept at the foot of a large tree, and made a
very small fire, for we did not dare to sleep without
one. We had collected the firewood very quietly.</p>

<p>At daylight we were up, and followed the path
leading towards the place where we thought the gorillas
had slept. We had walked several miles, and I
was ahead of Rogala, when suddenly I thought I
heard the breaking of branches ahead of me. Could
it be possible that a camp of natives was on our way.
I thought perhaps I had made a mistake, and that
the noise had been made by elephants either breaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
branches with their trunks or trampling in the jungle
and breaking the saplings in their path. I lay flat,
putting my ear to the ground, but did not hear the
heavy footsteps of elephants. I got up and said to
myself: "It is a heavy dead limb of a tree that fell
and was the cause of the noise I heard." Nevertheless
I walked more slowly to give time to Rogala to
overtake me. I had gone but a little way when I
heard the breaking of another sapling or tree-branch;
then I stopped and waited for Rogala.</p>

<p>Soon after I saw him coming, and I gave the "click"
warning, made with my tongue striking my palate.</p>

<p>At this sign Rogala stood still. I beckoned him to
come to me. I could not hear his footsteps as he
walked towards me. No leopard or night prowler in
search of prey could have made less noise.</p>

<p>As he came near me, I put one of the fingers of my
right hand upon my lips. This meant, "Be silent, do
not say a word." Then I put my left hand to my
ear; that meant, "Listen."</p>

<p>We remained silent looking anxiously at each other.
Suddenly another breaking of a limb of a tree was
heard. Rogala knew the cause of the noise, and
whispered, "Ngina."</p>

<p>We looked at each other without saying a word,
then looked at our guns. They were all right. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Rogala took the lead, and followed the path, for the
noise we heard came from that direction.</p>

<p>After a short walk we saw the branches of a tree
moving and being swayed to and fro by the ngina.
The tree was loaded with large fruits of the size of
oranges. The monster was breaking the branches,
and when they had fallen on the ground plucked
the fruit.</p>

<p>The jungle was so thick around the tree that we
could not see the huge creature. So we lay flat on
the ground, and advanced towards the tree, separating
the jungle on the right or on the left as we made our
way towards the monster.</p>

<p>I was so excited that I could hear my heart beat;
then I stopped.</p>

<p>The rustling ceased. We looked round and listened.
There was no more noise. All was silent; not even
the note of a bird or the pecking of a woodpecker
was heard.</p>

<p>I was just concluding that the huge creature had
departed, when suddenly we heard on our left three
most terrific yells following each other In succession.
These yells were followed by roars that filled the forest
with their din. I looked in the direction with my
rifle ready to fire. Then I saw peeping through the
leaves a black fierce face looking at us. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
horrid sight. The brute's eyes were sunken, while
a heavy overhanging ridge was over each. He gave
vent to yell after yell, resembling somewhat the barking
of an angry dog, but seeming to me a thousand
times louder. These were followed by terrific roars,
somewhat similar to those of lions, but louder. They
reverberated through the forest, from hill to hill, and
died away in the distance. The forest was filled with
the echo of his horrid voice.</p>

<p>Then his whole body came in sight; he was advancing
towards us, walking erect, to kill us. His short
legs were scarcely strong enough to support his huge
body. All at once he stopped and looked at us.
How vindictive his eyes looked! They seemed to
say to us: "You will soon be dead."</p>

<p>Then he beat his chest with his huge fist. How
long and muscular were his powerful arms! How
broad was his chest! His hair stood almost erect
on his body, and the hair on his head moved up
and down.</p>

<p>But our guns had been pointed at him from the
moment we saw him, and just as he was ready to
advance we fired in the direction of his heart, and the
great monster fell like a human being, face forward,
uttering a fearful groan, his limbs stretched out.
Then all became silent. He was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>His arms extended measured nearly nine feet;
around his chest measured nearly seven feet. He
was nearly five feet ten inches in height. We skinned
him on the spot, and hung his skin and skeleton on a
branch of a tree.</p>

<p>The following morning we went after the skin and
skeleton of the big beast Rogala and I had killed. I
put arsenic on the skin and stuffed it with dry leaves.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> day while out shooting birds, I came to a
part of the forest where I saw several kinds of
fruits and berries I had never seen before. Some
were beautiful to look at and very tempting, but I
did not dare to eat them for fear that they might be
poisonous.</p>

<p>Remembering what Rotembo had told me about
Ndova and other monkeys,&mdash;that they never made
a mistake in regard to fruits, berries, or nuts, and
never ate those that were poisonous, and threw
them away if given to them,&mdash;I determined to go
back to our camp and bring Ndova with me, and
show him the fruits.</p>

<p>The following morning I took Ndova with me,
leading him by a cord, for I was afraid of his running
away. When I came to that part of the forest
where I had seen so many berries, I tied Ndova to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
a tree, and went to collect them. On my return I
gave the most tempting one to Ndova. He smelt
of it and threw it away, giving at the same time that
peculiar grunt of dissatisfaction which he always uttered
when things did not please him. I gave him one of
another kind with the same result. I began to think
that all the berries I had collected were poisonous. I
gave him a third one. He smelt of it and gave it a
bite to taste it, then ate the rest with sounds of pleasure
very unlike the grunts he had uttered before.
Then I took him to the place where there were many
of these berries. He ate a lot, and filled his pouches.</p>

<p>I myself ate many of these berries. They tasted
very good. I was no longer afraid to eat them, for
what was good for the monkey was good for me.</p>

<p>After a while I gave Ndova a berry of another
kind, which he also ate. Seeing this, I put one in
my mouth, but took it out quickly it tasted so bitter.
So I found that Ndova and I had sometimes
not the same taste, and that some of the fruits, berries,
or nuts he ate, though they were not poisonous,
were very unpalatable to me. But afterwards in
other expeditions I had to eat them in order not
to die of starvation.</p>

<p>The next morning Rogala and I took Ndova with
us into the forest, and let him stay by himself. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
in a short time he returned. He was in a very angry
mood, expressed by peculiar sounds; his hair stood
up straight, a sign that he was afraid and angry. Not
knowing what the cause could be, we made ready for
any emergency, and then went towards the place from
which he had come. Soon we were rewarded by the
sight of a number of bees round a big hole in a tree.
Ndova had discovered a beehive, and, having been
stung by bees before, he had come back to us. We
were delighted and made preparations to smoke the
bees out and get the honey. We did so, and there
was a large quantity of it. We were so hungry that
we ate the wax and dead bees and the honey all together.
Ndova ate heartily with us.</p>

<p>After we had had our feast I petted Ndova and said
to him: "Ndova, you have found honey for us, now
help us to find some berries."</p>

<p>We continued our walk, and soon came upon fruit-bearing
trees. I gave one of the fruits to Ndova, but
he threw it away, giving a grunt of anger or dissatisfaction
at the same time. These fruits were red and
looked very tempting. I petted Ndova again, and
said: "Thank you, Ndova, for showing me that this
beautiful fruit is poisonous."</p>

<p>Further on I saw some nuts at the foot of a tree.
I broke one and gave it to Ndova. He ate it; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the nuts were good. We took a quantity of these
with us. Nuts are far more nutritious than berries,
and more wholesome.</p>

<p>We returned to the camp and were received with
great demonstrations of joy by Andekko. Ndova
made at once for Andekko and got on his back.
Andekko lay down, and Ndova began to play with
his hair. They had a grand time together, for Andekko
loved to be scratched.</p>

<p>After this I constantly took Ndova with me, and
found him very useful in finding berries, and sometimes
he walked by my side or rested on my shoulders
without being tied. One day he ascended a tree full
of small ripe fruits, uttered grunts of contentment at
his discovery, and began to eat while I was looking at
him. As I stood under the tree to get some of the
fruits that fell on the ground, I wondered whether
Ndova threw them at me intentionally or not. I
picked them up and tasted them. I found that they
had a pleasant acid taste. After a while Ndova came
down the tree with the pouch on each side of his
cheeks stretched to the utmost and filled with a stock
of the fruits to be eaten when hungry.</p>

<p>I had noticed that Ndova was apparently always
hungry, for monkeys can eat all the time.</p>

<p>We continued our way, and it was not long before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Ndova began to take food from his pouches, and he
soon emptied them. He seemed contented and happy;
he evidently liked very much the fruits he had eaten.</p>

<p>While we were taking our breakfast, one morning,
I said to Rogala: "To-day we will leave Ndova in
the camp and take Andekko with us. We must try
to kill some game and smoke the meat."</p>

<p>After our meal we made preparations to leave the
camp. Andekko was delighted when he saw us
handling our guns, for he knew from this that we
were going hunting and would take him with us.
We put Ndova into the house we had made for him;
we did not wish to leave him attached to his pole, for
we did not know what might happen. A big eagle
might pounce upon him, and being tied up to his
pole he would have no chance to flee. Perhaps a
huge python or some other big snake might come
within the enclosure and charm him, encircle him
within its powerful coils, squeeze him to death, and
swallow him. Ndova did not enjoy being shut up in
his house, and made us understand it by his shrill
cries of dissatisfaction as we went out.</p>

<p>Andekko was in high glee; he followed us for a
little while, then wandered off into the forest by himself,
and from time to time came back to us to make
sure, probably, of our presence. He had left us for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fifth or sixth time, when suddenly we heard his barking;
he was evidently after some gazelle or antelope.
We knew that he was coming in our direction as his
barking became louder and louder. We expected at
every moment to see an antelope or gazelle pass
before us. We were not mistaken. Erelong a
beautiful antelope with large spiral horns appeared,
followed by Andekko, barking at the beast in the
fiercest manner. A well-directed shot brought the
antelope down.</p>

<p>Then we cut the game to pieces, and made two
"otaitais" (baskets to carry on the back), and we put
a lot of the meat in them. On our return to the camp
we built a big platform, upon which we put the meat
and lighted fires to smoke it.</p>

<p>One day, not long after, Rogala said to me: "Oguizi,
the boars are very fat just now, for they feed on koola
nuts, and these are plentiful. I feel like having boar's
meat to eat."</p>

<p>As he said this, his mouth seemed twice as large
as usual. He evidently fancied he was eating fat
boar's-meat. I agreed with him, and we decided on
a boar-hunt. We put a lot of berries and nuts in
the cage of Ndova, and left plenty of bones for
Andekko, and departed for the hunting-ground where
the boars might be found. Quite a distance from our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
camp we could still hear Andekko barking and the
cries of Ndova.</p>

<p>We soon came to a koola tree and saw many nuts
on the ground. We thought we would get a meal
before the boars did, so we broke open many nuts
and ate them. Afterwards we hid near the trees. We
waited for a long time before any boars made their appearance.
At last we heard their grunts, and soon after
they were busy eating the koola nuts before us. We
picked out two of them, fired, and killed them both.
They were fat, as Rogala had said they would be. We
could not carry all the meat with us, so it was agreed
that Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai should return
the next day to fetch what we could not take. On returning
to camp, we built another platform for smoking
the boar's-meat.</p>

<p>"Now," said I to Rogala, "we have plenty of meat,
so we can go and hunt the 'men of the woods.'"</p>

<p>It was a curious coincidence that my hunters on
their return from fetching the boar's-meat next day
brought news of the "men of the woods." They
said: "Oguizi, to-day we saw a place where the
nshiego-mbouvés have been. They have come to
feed on a peculiar fruit that is just getting ripe, and
I am sure they will remain in the neighborhood where
we saw their tracks for a time. Let us go there."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>It was agreed that we would not fire at any other
animals, even if we saw an elephant with the biggest
of tusks. The men advised me to take "Bulldog"
with me, for we might meet nginas, who also were
fond of the fruit.</p>

<p>After a good night's rest we started, Rogala taking
a net with him to throw over a baby nshiego-mbouvé
or a baby ngina, if we should encounter any. We left
Ndova and Andekko in the camp this time also.</p>

<p>After a long walk we approached the ground where
the men expected to find nshiego-mbouvés. We were
startled by the voices of two of them. They were
talking to each other,&mdash;the male was calling for his
mate,&mdash;and as it was getting toward sunset Rogala
said: "He is calling his wife, for he thinks that it is
time to go to bed."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Rogala?" said I.</p>

<p>"These nshiego-mbouvés," he replied, "make resting-places
upon the trees to sleep in at night. The
'man' has one place, the 'woman' another. Let us
go carefully into the jungle and see if we can see their
'beds.'"</p>

<p>We did so, but found nothing, and decided to camp
for the night, Rogala's net making a nice soft pillow for
me. At dawn next day, when it was just light enough
to see our way, we ate a light breakfast and started for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>ward.
We soon came to a part of the forest where
there were many trees laden with the fruit Rogala had
mentioned. Soon we saw places where two nshiego-mbouvés
had been eating the day before, and where
after their meal they had rested on their backs, side
by side.</p>

<p>"See here," whispered Rogala; "there they rested,
for they had eaten too much. They will remain in
this region for a few days, for they find plenty to eat."</p>

<p>The others said: "We are sure to meet them if
we are patient, but the nshiego-mbouvés are so shy
that we must be extremely careful not to raise their
suspicions, otherwise they will escape from us."</p>

<p>At last Rogala gave a "cluck," stopped, and looked
at me. He put his finger upon his lips, a sign to keep
perfectly still; then put his hands to his ears, which
meant "Listen." We heard the voices of two nshiego-mbouvés
close to us. They were talking in a sort
of low tone or grunt. I looked at "Bulldog;" it
was all right. Rogala looked at the pan of his gun;
it was closed. He raised it; the powder was there.
Then he closed it again.</p>

<p>We advanced in the direction of the noise, when
suddenly Rogala stopped and made me a sign to lie
low on the ground. Then we crawled toward the
trunk of a big fallen tree. Rogala's quick ears had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
detected that the nshiego-mbouvés were coming in our
direction, and soon after, as we peeped over the trunk
of the tree, we saw a female nshiego-mbouvé with a
black face, then a very young nshiego-mbouvé near
her. His face was very white, as white as that of
any white child. The mother seated herself and
nursed the little fellow. It all looked very human.
She plucked some fruit, threw away the pulp, then
gave the inside to the little fellow, who said, "Whoe,
whoe." While he was eating this, she ate half a
dozen herself.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="pitifully"><img src="images/i_122.png" width="500"
height="773" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>He put his nose close to her face and moaned pitifully.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>She was getting dangerously near, and we ran the
risk of being discovered; then she might, in her fright,
disappear in the jungle before we had time to take a
good aim and shoot. Looking at Rogala, I raised
"Bulldog" and fired. The big nshiego-mbouvé fell,
and the little fellow ran up a tree, uttering shrill cries
of terror.</p>

<p>I whispered to Rogala: "Now let us get our net
ready to throw over the little nshiego when he comes
down the tree to see his mother."</p>

<p>We kept perfectly still. Soon the baby nshiego-mbouvé
came down the tree, and went up to his
mother, who was lying dead on her back. He put
his nose close to her face and moaned pitifully. He
seemed to know that she was dead. Rogala ran up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and threw the net over him. He shrieked fearfully.
We took him in that manner to the camp, and having
cut off the mother's head as a trophy, we took it
with us. But our little captive died soon after. We
could not keep him alive.</p>

<p class="i2">NDOVA'S THOUGHTFULNESS&mdash;HIS WINNING AND SPORTIVE
WAYS&mdash;HE FEELS LONELY AND CALLS FOR
OTHER MONKEYS TO COME TO HIM&mdash;A TROOP OF
ELEVEN APPEAR&mdash;I FRIGHTEN THEM AWAY</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I remained</span> all alone in the camp one day
while my hunters had gone hunting. Andekko
had gone with them. Everything was very quiet.</p>

<p>Ndova was very still and was thinking. There
was no mistake about it. His face showed it; his
eyes showed it. He had a wonderful and thoughtful
expression of sadness which went right to my
heart.</p>

<p>I wondered if he was sorry for his lot among us;
if he thought that he would be better off in the forest
with his own folk. Perhaps poor Ndova wanted a
mate to live with him. All I could tell, when I
looked at him, was that he seemed supremely sorrowful.
"What a pity," I said to myself, "that I cannot speak
or understand the ndova talk, for I could then by
talking to him find out what is the matter." Then I
wished I could understand the language of all the
monkeys of the forest. I knew about nine different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
kinds of monkeys living there; I could tell every
species by hearing them, for no two uttered the same
kind of sounds.</p>

<p>As I was thinking of these things, Ndova suddenly
jumped upon my shoulders, uttering at the same
time sounds of affection, and began at once to play
with my hair, which was always a favorite pastime
with him. When he got tired of this, he jumped
down on my lap, and began to play with my hand
and tried to get hold of two or three freckles I had
upon them. He tried and tried in vain to pick them
off; then he became excited, for he could not understand
why he could not take them off. It always
amused me to see Ndova vexed, for his eyes glared
in such a peculiar manner. At last he gave up trying
to pick off the freckles.</p>

<p>After this little outburst of temper he regained his
equanimity, and began to be himself again, full of
life and frolic. That made me feel happy, too, for I
thought a good deal of my friend Ndova. I did not
forget that he had sometimes saved me from hunger;
then did not his capers, queer gestures, and comical
grimaces amuse me many times? Was he not our
companion in the great forest, one of us indeed?
Andekko was a brave dog, but he had not the queer,
amusing ways of Ndova, nor his human look. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
sympathized always with Ndova when I thought he
felt lonely&mdash;for I often felt lonely myself, and longed
for friends and those of my kind.</p>

<p>Finally Ndova went to his cage, and began to eat
the nuts, berries, and fruits I had put there for him
in the morning. After he had satisfied his appetite
he filled his two pouches to their utmost capacity, the
skin of his cheeks being drawn quite tight over them.
He looked comical enough, with a big lump on each
side of his face.</p>

<p>When he came out of his cage, I tied him to the
ring of his pole so that he might go up and down as
he pleased. After he reached the top of the pole,
he seated himself on the platform and then became
thoughtful again. After a while he uttered that peculiar
sound he always gave when he called for his
species, the ndovas. When I saw this, I said to myself:
"Yes; when Ndova has a sad face, it is because he
feels lonely. That is the reason he calls for some of
his kind to come and keep him company."</p>

<p>From time to time he called, but no answer came
back; there were no ndovas around, but he was not
disheartened and kept calling. Finally an answer
came from far off. At this he grew excited, and went
up and down his pole several times.</p>

<p>I hid, so that if the monkeys came into our camp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they would not see me. I had a good hiding-place.
I could hear the advance of the monkeys in the noise
they made as they leaped from one flexible branch
to another. Now and then they would stop and hold
a conversation with Ndova. Soon after they perched
upon a tree from which they could look into our
camp. They remained silent for a while. The sight
was unusual to them. I was glad that Andekko had
gone with Rogala, for he would have barked at the
monkeys and frightened them away.</p>

<p>I counted eleven monkeys. One was much bigger
than the rest, and seemed to be their leader. He was
looking down intently at Ndova and the stockade.
He was evidently trying to make out what all that
new sight to him meant. He was suspicious of the
place and did not move. The monkeys would not
come to the palisades without his orders. They trusted
in his wisdom. He was evidently their chief. I
watched carefully his face, which seemed very sober.</p>

<p>After a while he talked to our monkey, all his followers
remaining silent. Ndova answered, with
sounds I had not heard before. "Oh dear," I said to
myself, "why do I not understand the language of
the ndovas, so that I might know what the old fellow
says to him? I think he wants to entice Ndova away
into the forest." I was almost sorry I had not my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
gun by my side. I think I should have shot him for
daring to try to make Ndova run away.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="palisades"><img src="images/i_130.png" width="500"
height="772" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>Soon I saw their heads peeping over the palisades.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>Ndova kept moving up and down his pole, now
and then running about on the ground, making great
efforts to get to his kind the ndovas.</p>

<p>Suddenly all the monkeys joined in a chorus, which
excited Ndova very much. Then they all came down
the tree together, and soon I saw their heads peeping
over the palisades and looking silently at Ndova, the
big fellow being in the centre of them, his big human-like
eyes glancing all round. Then they all uttered a
peculiar sound, which probably meant "Come on, come
on," for Ndova tried anew to go to them. But they
did not dare to come inside towards him. All at once
I emerged from my hiding-place, and at the sight
of me they fled, uttering piercing cries of fright.</p>

<p>On the return of Rogala I told him what had
happened.</p>

<p>He replied: "Oguizi, monkeys are a kind of
human beings."</p>

<p class="i2">UNEASINESS OF ROGALA&mdash;HE FEARS THE NEW MOON
MAY SEE AND BEWITCH HIM&mdash;HE BUILDS A SMALL
HOUSE AND HIDES IN IT&mdash;HE HAS AN ATTACK OF
FEVER, WHICH HE ASCRIBES TO WITCHCRAFT</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Not</span> long after this Shinshooko and Alapai went
away, saying that they would return in three
or four days and that Rogala would take care of me.</p>

<p>Rogala seemed to be in an uneasy frame of mind.
Something seemed to be disturbing him. I said
nothing on the subject, for I felt sure that he would
tell me at the proper time.</p>

<p>One morning he left the camp all alone, and returned
in the afternoon with a big load of palm leaves.
The following day he went again into the forest
by himself, and returned with a big load of bark.
That afternoon he began to build a very small house,
and roofed it with the palm leaves, and then made a
sliding door of bark. I wondered at his doings, and I
asked him why he made such a small house.</p>

<p>He answered: "Oguizi, two days from now will
be the day of the new moon, and though we cannot
see the moon, on account of the trees, her eyes can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
penetrate everywhere. The new moon is especially
angry and hungry on that day. She looks down over
our country and seeks whom she can devour, and we
poor black men are very much afraid of her on that
account, and we hide ourselves from her sight on that
night." After a pause he continued: "From the
time of the new moon to that of the full moon many
people die, and many amongst those are the ones
whom the new moon saw on her appearance in spite
of all the precautions they may have taken.</p>

<p>"So the night of the new moon I will go into the
little house I have just built, and remain silent all that
night, for if I spoke the new moon would know where
I was. I am going to bring plenty of firewood for
you." Then, with great earnestness and imploring
eyes, he said: "Please, Oguizi, put the wood yourself
on the fire, and do not call me out of the house, for if
I come out the moon is sure to see me and I shall be
a doomed man." And as he uttered these last words
he shuddered with fear, and then added: "Rogala, if
seen by the new moon, could not be with you the next
moon, for he would surely die before then."</p>

<p>The following morning Rogala collected a large
quantity of firewood, enough to last a few days.
Towards noon he spoke to his "ogana," or idol, thus:
"You know that I love you with all my heart. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
believe in you. Protect me from the spears, arrows,
and guns of my enemies. Let all those who try to
bewitch me and afflict me with illness or bad luck in
hunting and fishing, die. Let our people find out the
witches and sorcerers that cause sickness and death
amongst us."</p>

<p>Towards noon on that day he took his gun and
went hunting, leaving Ndova and Andekko behind.
Two hours afterwards he returned with a gazelle, or
"nchombee," on his back, and laid the animal at my
feet, saying: "I have killed this. Please take all you
want for yourself."</p>

<p>Andekko was looking with a hungry eye towards
the nchombee, but the long stick of Rogala kept
him at a proper distance. I cut off one of the forelegs
and threw it to the dog. Ndova was chattering
at the same time, looking searchingly at Rogala.
The sounds he uttered seemed to mean, "Have you
brought me no berries, fruits, or nuts?" Rogala
had brought him nothing, and he was very much
disappointed.</p>

<p>I chose half of the nchombee; then Rogala broiled
the other part on charcoal, and when it was cooked
took almost all of it and went into the forest, whither
I followed him. He walked but a short distance,
and then stopped before some very large leaves. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
plucked a few, and put them together on the ground,
and laid the meat of the nchombee upon them, saying:
"Olombo and Mombo, this nchombee is for
you. You know that I love you, and that I always
give you the best part of the game I kill." After this
sacrifice we returned to the camp.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="idol"><img src="images/i_136.png" width="500"
height="782" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
<i>Rogala and his idol.</i>
</div></div>

<p>Soon after he entered the little house he had built,
taking his bag with him, and shut the door behind
him. I heard him speak to his idol. When he came
out, his body was painted here and there. In the
hollow of his chest was a white spot, in the middle
of his forehead a white line between his eyes, and
there were long white stripes along his arms. He
wore all the mondahs his bag contained. He came
towards me, and looking at me, said: "Oguizi, sunset
is soon coming, and I must go into the little house,
and I shall remain there until after sunrise. You
have plenty of firewood. You have meat. There
is plenty of water in the spring, so you will be neither
thirsty nor hungry."</p>

<p>Before entering the house, he called aloud on the
spirits of his ancestors to watch over him, said good-night
to me, then disappeared into his little hut, and
shut the door so that the new moon could not possibly
see him.</p>

<p>I found myself alone in the camp. Ndova and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Andekko were my companions. Ndova entered his
house and soon after was asleep. Andekko stretched
himself by the fire. I wondered at all I had seen and
the wonderful animals I had killed since I had been
in that great forest; then putting lots of wood on
the fires, I lay down to sleep. In the middle of the
night Ndova uttered several shrill cries of fear which
resounded strangely. I jumped out of my bed, revolver
in hand, lighted a torch quickly, and went to
his house, followed by Andekko, who had been lying
by my side. Ndova's eyes glared, his hair stood
erect. He gave several grunts, and jumped from one
part of his house to the other. Something had evidently
disturbed him. Looking carefully on the
ground, I saw the trail of a huge snake.</p>

<p>While all this was going on within his hearing,
Rogala did not dare to say a word. All was perfectly
silent in his little house. When he came out in the
morning, he said to me: "The new moon did not
see me."</p>

<p>In the afternoon Shinshooko and Alapai made their
appearance. They had gone into the forest to hide,
fearing that the moon would mark them also for
destruction.</p>

<p>The following day Rogala went hunting and returned
with a very high fever. He had had a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
chill on the way. His skin was very hot, and he had
a very violent headache. I made him lie down, and
lighted several fires round him to act as blankets. I
was afraid he had an attack of malignant fever, which
carries off people very quickly, sometimes in less
than twelve hours. I gave him a very large dose of
quinine, and bathed his burning head with cool water
from the spring. I watched over him all night.</p>

<p>He was better the next day, and said to me:
"Oguizi, some persons have bewitched me; they
are jealous, for you are my friend, and you love me, a
poor slave, and they say, 'Why should the great
Oguizi love Rogala?' and they want me to die."</p>

<p>I replied, "Rogala, nobody wants you to die."</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied very earnestly, "somebody wants
me to die, but fortunately I have a powerful mondah
which is stronger against witchcraft than the machinations
and incantations of the sorcerers or witches."</p>

<p>While he was talking, I said to myself: "I suppose
that if Rogala should die while with me, the people
would say that I had caused his death; that I wanted
his spirit to follow me when I left the country because
I loved him." I remembered that a man had died
the day after I had left a village, and the people there
to this day believe that I caused his death for this
reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
So I was very anxious about Rogala, for not only
should I regret his death, but I could not foretell
what would happen afterwards.</p>

<p>But he got quite well soon, though his face began
again to show signs of anxiety. He seemed almost
afraid of our camp, and even suggested that we might
build another camp at some other place. He hinted
that the place had been bewitched.</p>

<p>"By whom?" I asked, laughing.</p>

<p>"I do not know," he answered.</p>

<p>"Only your friends Shinshooko and Alapai have been
here. You do not mean to say that they wish you
to be ill and die? Do not be afraid," I said earnestly,
in order to convince him. "You will not die; the
Oguizi will keep you with him."</p>

<p>These words seemed to reassure him somewhat, but
I could see that he was still anxious.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="i2">ROGALA LEAVES THE CAMP&mdash;NON-APPEARANCE OF
SHINSHOOKO AND ALAPAI&mdash;WHAT HAPPENED TO
ROGALA ON HIS JOURNEY&mdash;HE RETURNS AFTER
FOUR DAYS WITH A POWERFUL MONDAH WHICH
HE BURIES BEFORE THE CAMP</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> next day after our talk Rogala, bending low
and taking one of my feet in both his hands,
said with great fervor: "Oguizi, I want to go home,
and if you let me go I will be back in four days.
Yes," he repeated, "I will be back in four days.
Shinshooko and Alapai will remain with you."</p>

<p>I said: "You can go, Rogala." I did not wish to
ask him why he wanted to go home, but I suspected
that he wanted to consult the big idol about the illness
from which he had recovered, and to try to find
out who had bewitched him.</p>

<p>Early the following morning he departed, and I
followed him for a short distance and bade him an
affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>I had learned to love Rogala, for he was thoughtful,
affectionate, and brave. When with me I always
felt that he would never leave me in the lurch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Strange to say, Shinshooko and Alapai did not
come back that day or night. Were they lost, or
had they been killed by gorillas or elephants?</p>

<p>Andekko seemed to know that I was left all alone,
and was watching most carefully, walking constantly
around our fence and sniffing to find out if there
were intruders near. When he had gone round two
or three times, he would come back and lie at my
feet. Twice during the day he growled, but a few
words addressed to him prevented him from barking.
We had taught him not to bark when within the
camp, but at every growl he gave I listened attentively.
Perhaps he had heard the footsteps of Shinshooko
and Alapai. Each time the noise had probably
been made by some passing antelope or other animal.
At any rate, my ladder was inside, and no enemy
could reach me unawares.</p>

<p>I did not go out that day. I cleaned "Bulldog"
and my other guns, and mended my clothes.</p>

<p>At night I lighted two extra big fires. How
strange was the glare of the flames among the big
trees that surrounded me! The wind was blowing
very hard, for I could hear the rustling of the leaves
on the top of the trees. Twice I heard the piercing
cries of owls.</p>

<p>I hardly slept. Andekko was wide awake, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
ears pricking up at the least noise. Now and then
he would go round and round, and when he had made
sure that there was nothing, he would return and lie
by the fire. At last morning came.</p>

<p>After my breakfast I left the camp, leaving the
premises in charge of Andekko, after giving him a
good meal and providing more food for him. As I
marched along, Ndova, who accompanied me, was
looking for something to eat. I heard him utter
the chuckle that always meant he had found something
good. I went towards him, and found him
regaling himself. Looking round, I saw growing on
the trunk of a tree large grape-like bunches of a
beautiful fruit of a bright scarlet color. Each fruit
was of the shape of a very large olive. There were
about ten of these bunches on the trunk, and each
was about fifteen to eighteen inches long. The seed
was large, but the pulp was quite juicy and somewhat
acid, with a very pleasant flavor. I petted Ndova to
show him that I appreciated his discovery.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If I could have followed Rogala with my eyes on
his way from the time he left the camp, I could have
seen him (as I afterwards learned from his own account,
when he returned) the first day tramping along
as fast as he could, now and then stopping and taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
his idol from his bag and putting it on the ground,
and then talking to her as he would to an old trusted
friend; asking her to protect him against witchcraft,
to kill his enemies, and to let him go back safe
to the Oguizi. When the evening came, he lighted
several fires, and took again his little idol from his
bag, and made numerous invocations to her. Poor
Rogala was very unhappy, for he was fully persuaded
that somebody had bewitched him. During the night
he heard an owl, and he thought some of his enemies
had taken that shape and were following him.</p>

<p>The following day, at daybreak, Rogala left the
place where he had slept, and walked as fast as his
legs could carry him; then he came to a small plantation
where lived a great medicine man, and promised
him three brass rods which I had given him if
he would follow him. The medicine man assented;
then they went to a place where years before Rogala
had buried a powerful mondah to drive away witchcraft
from the place.</p>

<p>The medicine man made many incantations over
the mondah before Rogala dug it out. The mondah
was composed of several skulls of nshiegos and bones
of other animals. When he had dug up all the relics,
Rogala packed them carefully in the otaitai he had
with him, then rose and retraced his steps towards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
our camp, carrying with him the powerful mondah
which was to drive away witchcraft from our camp.
He was now happy.</p>

<p>The morning of the day that Rogala had promised
to return I went into the forest without taking
Ndova or Andekko with me. I had "Bulldog,"&mdash;not
that I wanted to use it, but I thought it was prudent
to have my most powerful weapon with me; "for,
who knows?" said I to myself, "somebody might
come into our camp and steal my best friend 'Bulldog.'
It is better to be on the safe side in case
something unforeseen should happen." I also took
with me a hundred steel-pointed bullets.</p>

<p>I found a place where there was a kind of berry I
had not seen before, but I did not dare to eat any
before Ndova had tasted of them. I took a few of
them with me to give them to him on my return. If
they were good, then I would come to get more the
following day. I continued to go further, thinking that
I might find a koola tree, when, to my terror, I found
that I had been on the point of stepping over a huge
snake, my heel almost brushing it as it touched the
ground. The snake lay across the path, and was
just the color of the dead leaves. I ran instinctively
from the reptile, then stopped. I could not help it,
but every time I came unawares upon a dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
snake my first impulse was always to move away
quickly. Then, when I thought I was out of danger,
I took my hunting-knife and cut a long, somewhat
slender stick, then retraced my steps and looked at
the snake. It was thick and short, with a triangular
head. I could see by the shape of its head that it
was poisonous. Raising my stick, I let it fall heavily
upon its spine, breaking it and thus preventing the
ugly reptile from turning upon me and from retreating
or advancing. But the breaking of his spine did not
prevent him from hissing at me when I faced him.
Another blow crushed his head; his fangs could not
possibly do any more harm, and how big these were!
I cut his head off and threw it away. Then I saw
that he had swallowed a tiny little gazelle that was
not yet digested. I cut the snake into several pieces
to take with me to the camp, for I knew that my
hunters were very fond of snakes. Then I retraced
my steps towards the camp.</p>

<p>As I approached, I thought I saw through the
jungle a man by the fence just at the foot of the
ladder. I was astounded. I could not believe my
eyes. Had any one discovered our abode? Was
the inside of our fortress full of enemies waiting for
Rogala, Shinshooko, Alapai, and me? How was it
that Andekko did not bark? Had they killed dear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Andekko? Ndova's voice was not to be heard.
Was he killed also? I looked at "Bulldog," then
lay flat on the ground and crawled, like a snake, on
my stomach towards the man. I lost sight of him
for a few seconds, and I thought he had gone.
"Then," said I to myself, "our abode has been discovered,
and this man has gone to tell the news to his
people, who will surely come and attack us."</p>

<p>Fortunately I got sight of the man again. I stood
perfectly still, watching him through the jungle.
Suddenly it occurred to me that his skin was of the
same color as that of Rogala. I looked and looked.
Yes, it was Rogala. There was no mistake about it.
I recognized his body, though at first I could not
recognize his face, for it was so disfigured by being
painted with ochre. One side was yellow, the other
side white, and his forehead was red.</p>

<p>But what was he doing? I came nearer and watched.
I saw his idol by his side, and near it skulls of animals,
pieces of broken plates from the white man's
country, and some large sea-shells. I recognized the
skulls as those of nshiegos and two or three as those
of monkeys. I saw Rogala bury them at the foot of
the ladder; then he covered them with earth, put dead
leaves upon the spot, and tried to make it as natural-looking
as it was before. Then he went to the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
where we hid the ladder, and came back with it.
Taking a monkey he had killed, he climbed the ladder,
and soon after was inside. I heard Andekko's bark
of joy and Ndova's muttering of contentment.</p>

<p>I remained still awhile, then went hunting again, so
that when I returned Rogala could not possibly suspect
that I had seen him, and about two hours afterwards
I returned to the camp.</p>

<p>Dear Rogala was very happy to see me again. Immediately
after his arrival he had made a big fire to
get charcoal in order to roast the monkey he had
killed on his way back to the camp. In the meantime
I presented him with the pieces of the snake I
had killed. The berries I had gathered were good,
for Ndova ate them, and when I tasted them I found
them very palatable. Then Rogala lighted his pipe
and looked at me.</p>

<p>His body had been cut very badly by the sword-grass;
so he washed himself with warm water, then
rubbed himself with oil, and lay flat on a mat by
the fire. He was very tired. As he saw that I was
looking at him, he said:</p>

<p>"The reason I am so cut by the sword-grass is
because I travelled a part of the night. I had told
you that I would be back on the fourth day and I
wanted to keep my word. I walked with a torch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
which I made from the gum of an elimi tree I
found on the way, but though the torch gave a good
light, once in a while I found myself entangled in the
midst of long sword-grass." Then he added: "If I had
not found that elimi tree, I could not have walked in
the dark, for if I had been without a torch a prowling
leopard in search of prey might have pounced upon
me, and then you would never have seen your friend
Rogala again."</p>

<p>Before we went to sleep I said: "Rogala, I know
where you have been, I know why you left me."
Rogala's face began to appear frightened, for he evidently
thought I knew what he had done. Without
giving him time to reply, I continued: "You went
to dig up an old mondah from the ground, and you
brought it here; you have buried it where we hang
our ladder."</p>

<p>Rogala looked at me with a sort of dread, then taking
hold of my feet, he said: "Oguizi, you know everything."
Then he told me what I have just recounted
to you, and concluded: "Now no witchcraft can
come here."</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards Shinshooko and Alapai, who
had gone to see if any animals had been caught in
their various traps, returned, but without game.</p>

<p class="i2">WE DISCOVER A PAIR OF NSHIEGO-NKENGOS&mdash;DESCRIPTION
OF THEM&mdash;CAPTURE OF A YOUNG ONE&mdash;HE
MAKES FRIENDS WITH NDOVA AND ANDEKKO&mdash;HIS
SPEEDY DEATH</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> day at daylight Rogala and I left our camp,
I taking my light rifle, and Rogala his gun and
a net. After we had climbed over our fence we could
hear Andekko barking and Ndova's voice of discontent.
They wanted to go with us and disliked being
left behind.</p>

<p>After about four hours' tramp we came to the
region of the pineapple, and we stopped there. At
the end of about two hours more, we were startled by
the voice of a "man of the woods." Rogala whispered
to me: "Nshiego-nkengo! He is not very far from
us." In the distance we heard the voice of his mate
answering his call. They kept answering each other;
but neither Rogala nor I could understand them, for
they were speaking the language of the nshiego-nkengos.
Rogala whispered to me: "The 'man' is
telling his mate to come, for he has found pineapples.
Let us go towards him and hide ourselves."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
We went forward as noiselessly as a fish or a leopard.
We advanced slowly, looking upon the ground each
time we put down our feet, for fear of stepping upon
some little dead branches of trees. We put aside
most carefully with one of our hands the jungle that
was in our way, for we knew that the least noise would
make the animals suspicious.</p>

<p>On account of the great care we took to make no
noise our advance was very slow, but forward we
went, and nearer and nearer we came to the "men
of the woods." At last we heard the rustling they
made as they moved about in the jungle. We advanced
with still greater care, when, lo! I saw the
two creatures. I did not even dare to give a click
of warning, for fear that their quick ears would
hear it. Fortunately Rogala had seen them also.
We looked at each other, and I made a sign to
him that we must not fire at them, and to remain
where we stood.</p>

<p>The two nshiego-nkengos had their backs turned
towards us, so we could not see their faces. They
were seated close together. Now and then they
stretched out their arms to reach the pineapples before
them. I could hear them biting them, uttering now
and then a peculiar sound of contentment, showing
how pleased they were with their food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
The hair covering their bodies was thin and black,
and I could see that it grew over a yellow skin. I
could also see the backs of the large yellow ears.
That was all. There were many pineapples all round
them.</p>

<p>I was much excited. Then the nshiegos turned partly
round and I could see their profiles. I saw their pale
yellowish faces, which reminded me of the color of the
sunburnt Moor of the desert, but no sun had given
them that complexion, for the sun does not penetrate
the forest. I noticed that their ears were somewhat the
shape of those of man, but much larger, and that the
lobes were flattened. Their lips were so thin that
the mouth seemed to have been made by the skin
being cut transversely, but it was very large. They
had long slender hands, with palms whiter than their
faces; their feet were also very long and slender.
Their legs had no calves, and were very short. Their
arms were very long. They gradually turned right
towards us. Their faces were wrinkled like those of
very old people, some of whom have that peculiar
colorless skin. Their eyes looked strange and had
something human in them, and seemed to be all the
time on the lookout.</p>

<p>The male got hold of a large yellow pineapple
that was quite ripe, and the female took it away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
from him. He uttered a sort of guttural sound, as
if to say, "All right, you are welcome to it," and
he picked another. Then they began to pick them
one after another, and four mouthfuls disposed of a
large pineapple.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="pineapples"><img src="images/i_154.png" width="500"
height="778" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>The two nshiego-nkengos had their backs turned towards
us and were eating pineapples</i>."
</div></div>

<p>After a while they moved away. Rogala raised his
gun, looking at me. I made a sign to him not to
fire. I did not want to kill them. "Perhaps we
shall meet them in the forest," I said to myself, "and
I may have a chance to study their ways." I did not
even shout to scare them. They moved off gradually,
and we went back to our camp.</p>

<p>The following day we took Andekko with us.
Towards noon we were startled by the fierce barking
of the dog, and heard the shrill cry of a nshiego-nkengo.
Soon we came to the place, and saw Andekko
looking up a tree at a young nshiego which I
thought to be about a year old, and barking fiercely.
He was glaring at the dog, the hair of his body erect,
and was uttering sounds of defiance, not of fear. He
seemed to know that he was safe where he was, and
that the dog could not climb the tree.</p>

<p>"Let us try to capture the baby nshiego-nkengo if
we can," said I to Rogala.</p>

<p>In the meantime Andekko kept barking at the
little fellow, who kept looking at him, uttering now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and then a sort of "whoe, whoe." He seemed to say
to the dog, "You cannot catch me." Here we were,
Rogala, Andekko, and I, at the foot of the tree, and
the young nshiego-nkengo looking at us from one of
its branches.</p>

<p>We found that from a young tree with slender
branches he had succeeded in reaching the tree where
he was. The only thing to be done was to watch for
the time when, driven by hunger, he would come
down.</p>

<p>In the meantime we heard far away in the distance
the calls of his mother. We kept a sharp lookout
for her, for though nshiegos are very shy, we were
not sure that she would not attack us. She evidently
thought her young one was somewhere in
the forest looking for her. We spoke loud to
scare her.</p>

<p>At last I said to Rogala: "Watch here while I go
to the camp to feed Ndova, for the probability is that
we shall have to sleep at the foot of the tree to-night."</p>

<p>I went to the camp and fed Ndova, and returned
with some food and two axes. Andekko was almost
exhausted from his constant barking, which had become
quite hoarse and indistinct. The yellow pale
face of the little nshiego-nkengo with his big eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
looked at us from his tree. The evening came, and
there was no prospect of his coming down.</p>

<p>We slept in the forest, the little nshiego-nkengo
still on the tree. "The only thing for us to do,
Rogala," said I in the morning, "is to cut the
tree down. Then we will watch and throw the net
over him."</p>

<p>"That is so, Oguizi," replied Rogala; "only we
must see that Andekko does not get hold of him, for
he will surely strangle him."</p>

<p>We set to work, and soon the young tree fell with
the little nshiego, and before Andekko had time to
nab him, Rogala had thrown the net over him. We
had quite a job to keep Andekko away, and not
before Rogala had shown him a stick he had great
respect for, was he quieted.</p>

<p>We returned to the camp with our prize, and by
daylight we heard the mother's loud calls. The little
fellow responded with shrieks. Andekko barked
furiously, and in an instant we were outside our palisades,
leaving Andekko within. Shortly after we succeeded
in approaching the old nshiego-nkengo unseen,
and killed her.</p>

<p>Ndova did not seem to take to the addition to our
family. The two looked at each other in a strange
way. But the next day they were more friendly, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the third day they had become friends, and were trying
to discover insects upon each other's bodies. It
took a few days more to make Andekko and Nshiego
friends. Finally, however, the great pleasure of Andekko
was to lie down by Nshiego and let himself be
scratched. In three days Nshiego had become quite
tame, but in less than a week he died.</p>

<p class="i2">MY RECKONING LOST&mdash;ROGALA AND I GO TO AN
ISLAND WHERE I CAN SEE THE HEAVENS&mdash;WE
REACH IT BY A RAFT AND BUILD A HOUSE&mdash;TURTLE'S
EGGS IN PROFUSION</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">I had</span> been so long in the forest and had led such
a life that I could not remember the day of the
week and the date of the month. I was not sure
whether I was at the end of July or at the beginning
of August, nor could I tell if I was north or south of
the equator.</p>

<p>The only way for me to find out these things was
to make astronomical observations, to find out my
latitude and longitude. While in that great and apparently
boundless forest I compared myself to a
mariner, all alone in a boat, without compass, in the
middle of the ocean, having for days a cloudy and
gray sky above his head which hid the sun, the moon,
and the stars from his sight, so that he could not know
in what direction to steer his boat. The foliage of the
trees above my head took the place of the gray and
cloudy sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
I said to Rogala, Shinshooko, and Alapai: "It is a
long time since I have seen the sun, the moon, and
the stars, for when I look up I see nothing but leaves
which hide the heavens from my sight. I wish to go
to a large open place, to a river where I can see the sun,
the moon, and the stars, for I want to speak to them
and consult them."</p>

<p>When my hunters heard me speak in that manner,
all three looked at me with wonder. Their eyes
stood wide open with astonishment and seemed to be
twice as big as before.</p>

<p>Rogala replied: "Oguizi, about two days' journey
from our camp there is a river with a long sandy
island which always comes out during the dry season
when the water is low. On that island you will be
able to see the sun, the moon, and the stars."</p>

<p>It was agreed that Shinshooko and Alapai should
return to their home and tell the news about us to be
sent to Chief Rotembo.</p>

<p>By daylight the following day we were ready to
start. We hid the ladder at some distance from our
camp, and bade one another farewell. Shinshooko
and Alapai soon disappeared from our sight.</p>

<p>We took an old hunting-path that led to the river
and sandy island. Rogala and I had each a heavy
load to carry. Rogala carried the "precious box" on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
his back in an otaitai, some smoked elephant meat,
his gun, ammunition, two axes, a machete, and some
food. I carried "Bulldog," ammunition, and koola
nuts. Andekko and Ndova had nothing to carry.
Andekko seemed to know that we were on a journey
and that he had to follow us. Ndova was tied on the
"precious box" and stood on the top of it.</p>

<p>The hunting-path was almost obliterated, as it was
so seldom used. Trees had fallen across it in many
places. In some the jungle had grown over it. In
others we had to pass under the branches of some
fallen trees or walk on the roots.</p>

<p>Towards noon we stopped to eat and rest a little
while, then we continued on our way. How silent
was the forest! Not even the shrill cry of a monkey
or of a parrot was heard. Once in a while we
could hear the fall of a leaf or the gentle murmur
of some little stream winding its way towards some
unknown river.</p>

<p>A little before dark we stopped, and made our camp
for the night. We collected a large quantity of dead
branches of trees that had fallen on the ground for
our fires, and lighted many, and after a hearty meal of
boiled elephant meat we fell asleep.</p>

<p>By daylight we were up and continued our journey.
We slept again in the forest, though we were near the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
river. The following morning we stood upon its
bank, and I saw in the middle of the stream a long
sandy island.</p>

<p>Rogala, pointing out the island to me, said: "Oguizi,
this is the island of which I spoke."</p>

<p>Putting our loads on the ground, we took our axes,
and cut down trees to build a raft.</p>

<p>When the raft was ready, Rogala put upon it
the "precious box," Ndova, and Andekko, and then
crossed to the island. Ndova was very much afraid
of the water, and clung to Rogala, who, after landing
the box, the monkey, and the dog, came back
for me.</p>

<p>An exclamation of joy arose involuntarily to my
lips as I landed. How lovely was the blue sky, in
the midst of which transparent white clouds were
moving slowly! How cheerful was the sunshine!
It felt so good to tread upon the soft white sand, to
be in a place where there was not a tree, not even a
blade of grass. In a word, the island was beautifully
bare of vegetation. I was so tired of trees and of the
forests. I rolled in the sand, lay on my back, and
looked at the blue sky.</p>

<p>"We will remain on this island for a few days," I
said to Rogala, "and to-morrow we will build a shelter
for ourselves. During the day we will go into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
forest to hunt and seek food. In the evening we will
return to the island."</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="island"><img src="images/i_164.png" width="500"
height="756" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>When the raft was ready Rogala, Ndova, and Andekko
crossed to the island</i>."
</div></div>

<p>We crossed the river again on our raft, leaving
Andekko and Ndova in possession of the island.</p>

<p>We collected building material, cut poles and sticks,
gathered large leaves to be used instead of slates or
shingles for roofing, and for walls wide pieces of bark;
also much firewood. After a few trips all our material
was landed on the island.</p>

<p>First I measured the ground, and decided that the
house should be about ten feet long and seven feet
wide. We planted sticks about one foot apart, reaching
a height of about five feet above the ground. Then
we fastened the bark along these sticks, and left an
opening to be used as a door, and made a few loopholes
so that we could fire from them in case we were
attacked by the natives. I always took great precautions,
though I was not afraid of the people. My
guns, rifles, a certain amount of ammunition were
always near my bed. I slept dressed and with my
shoes on. "Always be ready in case of a sudden
attack," I said to Rogala, and he replied: "You are
right, Oguizi."</p>

<p>Then we placed a beam upon two big forked sticks
to support the roof, and covered our roof with the large
leaves, arranging them on the top of one another just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
like shingles. We also built a platform in case we
should need it for smoking meat.</p>

<p>Then I walked all over the island, and discovered
buried in the sand a number of turtle's eggs, to my
great joy, for turtle's eggs are very good to eat. There
were so many of them that we should not have starved
had we remained quite a while on the island, for not
only did we find many eggs but we captured a number
of turtles. When I returned from my tour of investigation,
Rogala was talking to his idol.</p>

<p>We boiled a number of turtle's eggs, and having
salt with us we enjoyed them immensely. If I had
had some oil or wild boar's fat, what delicious turtle's-egg
omelette we could have made! After breakfast
we fished, and were lucky enough to catch some fish,
to our great delight. These we broiled on charcoal
for our dinner. The day passed rather slowly, for I
was anxious for the night to come.</p>

<p class="i2">APPEARANCE OF THE SOUTHERN HEAVENS AT NIGHT&mdash;HOMESICKNESS&mdash;I
TAKE SEVERAL OBSERVATIONS&mdash;ASTONISHMENT
OF ROGALA&mdash;FIND THAT I AM
NINETY MILES SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">At</span> last the sun set behind the trees. Darkness
came on, and the stars made their appearance
one by one. Soon the heavens glittered with them.
The murmur of the wind passing through the top of
the trees and the gentle noise of the river gliding
along the shores were all that disturbed the absolute
silence of the night. I was happy to see the stars
again. How beautiful they were in the blue heavens!</p>

<p>I gazed upon them silently for quite a while, then
I said to them: "I love you, dear twinkling stars, for
you are my friends and companions of the night.
Without you I should be lost in this great forest.
You and the moon tell me where I am. I miss you
ever so much when I am without you. I feel lonely
without you."</p>

<p>But I missed many of the stars that I loved at
home. The little ship that had carried me across
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the ocean to those southern latitudes had taken me
away from them. Many stars that were unknown to
me had taken their place, and though they were beautiful
and I admired them, I did not love them. The
stars that twinkle and look down upon the bright
glittering snow, the Mississippi, the Rocky Mountains,
the Alleghanies, upon our great lakes, prairies, dales,
and hills, upon the pine, the oak, the beech, the
elm, and the birch, upon the violets, buttercups, and
goldenrods, were those I loved the best.</p>

<p>An uncontrollable fit of sadness seized me as I
missed them. I thought of home, of friends. Tears
filled my eyes, I could not help it. Fortunate was it
that Rogala was not near me. He might have thought
that the Oguizi was, after all, a human being.</p>

<p>But there were stars that were old friends. The
Pleiades were there, the stars of the constellation of
the Great Bear. Vega, that I loved so much at
home, seemed to be right above me; so were Aldebaran
and the stars of the constellation of Orion. Here the
position of the stars made the sword perfectly straight.</p>

<p>The sky of the southern hemisphere was very unlike
that of the northern. One of the most striking sights
was the constellation of the Cross, commonly known
by mariners as the Southern Cross, composed of four
brilliant stars. The three brightest stars in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
heavens, Sirius, Canopus, Centaur, filled a part of the
heavens with their light.</p>

<p>Mars, Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter were looking upon
me. That part of the Milky Way between the stars
Sirius and Centaur was so rich in stars and crowded
nebulæ that it seemed a perfect blaze of light.</p>

<p>There were the Magellanic clouds, white-looking
patches, made up of countless stars unseen to the eye,
and nebulæ,&mdash;stars in formation,&mdash;shining brilliantly
and revolving round the starless South Pole.</p>

<p>Then, looking northward, I saw the constellation of
the Great Bear, which reaches its meridian altitude at
about the same time as the constellations of the Cross
and of the Centaur.</p>

<p>I gazed upon the heavens almost all of the night.
I was perfectly oblivious of everything else. Stars
appeared and disappeared. They were like a succession
of guests coming and going.</p>

<p>At last I said good-night to the stars, and pulling my
old panama hat over my head, to protect my eyes from
the rays of the moon, I soon fell asleep on the sand,
under the blue heavens and the stars twinkling over me.
I dreamt of friends, of boys and girls at home, of the
North Star, of snow, of strawberries, peaches, and jam.
I was suddenly awakened by the sharp barking of
Andekko. It was broad daylight. Rogala was cook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>ing
turtle's eggs. Ndova was looking at me. All
the stars had disappeared, and the sun had risen to
give life and food to the sons of men, for without the
sun there would be no life, no vegetation upon the
earth. I spent the day quietly, waiting impatiently
for the night to take astronomical observations.</p>

<p>After sunset I said to Rogala: "Bring me the
'precious box.'" After he had laid it at my feet I
opened it.</p>

<p>Rogala stood up close to me, looking on with mingled
feelings of curiosity and fear. First, I took from
the box two sextants&mdash;one was to determine the altitude
of the stars, planets, and moon; the other the
distance between them from east to west, or <i>vice versa</i>.
Then I took out a trough, which I filled up with
quicksilver to be used as an artificial horizon, on
which the stars were to be reflected.</p>

<p>From a little copper-screwed water-tight box I took
two watches out of four which all marked the seconds,
a bull's-eye lantern, and other objects that excited the
wonder of Rogala. Before taking the observations, I
thought I would have some fun with Rogala. I
placed my telescope in position for Jupiter and said
to him: "In the land of the Oguizi this star is called
Jupiter. Do you see little stars round it?" I meant
the satellites.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="horizon"><img src="images/i_172.png" width="550"
height="339" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>When I was ready to take observations, I
seated myself cross-legged before the artificial horizon.</i>"
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
"No," he replied.</p>

<p>"There are stars near it," said I, "but your eyes
cannot see them. I will show them to you."</p>

<p>Then I made him look with the telescope towards
Jupiter, and he saw the satellites. He looked at me
with awe, then with wonder. Fortunately he knew I
would not harm him, but throwing himself at my feet,
he took hold of them and exclaimed: "You are a
great Oguizi. My eyes have seen what no other black
man's have seen before;" then he got up and in a loud
voice invoked the spirits of his ancestors to protect
and watch over him, and shouted, "Great indeed is
the Oguizi."</p>

<p>When I was ready to take observations, I seated
myself cross-legged before the artificial horizon. On
my right was a sextant to take the distance between
the moon and the lunar stars that were in position.
Close by was one of the watches; also the magnifying-glass
to help me to read the degrees, minutes, and
seconds on the sextant.</p>

<p>On my left was the sextant for taking altitudes,
near which was the slate with pencil to write down the
figures, and the bull's-eye lantern was lighted to help
me to read the sextant. Also a thermometer for
ascertaining the temperature.</p>

<p>The most important thing was to make the obser<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>vations
as quickly as possible and read from the watch
the space of time between them.</p>

<p>After spending four hours in making observations I
stopped. I looked at Rogala. He was fast asleep,
for he was very tired and had worked hard during the
day. I awoke him, and we went to our little hut and
lay down to sleep. We knew that if natives came up
or down the river Andekko would warn us in time.</p>

<p>When I awoke, Rogala was still asleep. Ndova had
his eyes shut and his head was hanging down on his
breast. Andekko lay across the door, apparently
asleep, but as soon as he heard me he wagged his tail
and followed me to the river and remained by me
until I had had a good bath.</p>

<p>For three days and three nights I worked very
hard. I took many observations, and made calculations
which showed my latitude, longitude, the day
of the month and of the week, and gave me the
month in which I was. I found that it was Wednesday,
the 17th of August, that I was ninety miles
south of the equator, and two hundred and ten miles
in the interior.</p>

<p class="i2">WE CROSS THE RIVER AND HIDE OUR AXES&mdash;NDOVA'S
FRIGHT AT A PYTHON&mdash;ANDEKKO FINDS A LEOPARD'S
LAIR&mdash;WE CAPTURE TWO LEOPARD CUBS&mdash;A
VISIT FROM SAVAGES&mdash;THEY ARE FRIGHTENED
BY MY WATERBURY CLOCK</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Now</span> that I knew from my astronomical observations
where I was, and what was the day of the
month and week, I said to Rogala: "Let us go and
hunt in the forest, for possibly I may kill some
animals or birds I have never seen before. I have
done talking to the stars, the moon, and the sun for
some time now."</p>

<p>As we were ready to go across the river, I said to
Rogala: "We must take our axes with us, for who
knows if some wandering natives may not be roaming
here and take our raft? If we have our axes, we can
make another one quickly." Then we embarked,
taking also Andekko and Ndova with us.</p>

<p>After landing, we hid our axes carefully in two different
places; one was put in the hollow of a tree, the
other under dried leaves. We were walking silently,
Rogala leading, for the path was very difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
follow, being often obliterated by the jungle or fallen
branches.</p>

<p>All at once Ndova ran towards me, seeming very
much frightened. His eyes were almost starting out
of his head, and he sprang upon me and held fast and
close to my clothing. He looked in a certain direction,
then uttered a cry of anger and defiance towards the
place. I whispered to Rogala: "What can be the
cause of Ndova's fright and anger? Look at his
hair! It is standing up all over his body."</p>

<p>"Probably a snake," replied Rogala.</p>

<p>We went carefully towards the spot whence Ndova
had come, and saw a huge python coiled round a tree,
watching for prey. We killed the reptile, which was
nearly twenty feet long. Rogala cut it into many
pieces, packed them together in large leaves, and hung
the parcel on the branch of a tree, and said with evident
glee: "When we return I will take the parcel
with me, for the snake is fat, and will make good
soup."</p>

<p>We continued to follow the path, looking all around
us for game, and walked as lightly as we could. The
footsteps of Rogala, who wore no shoes, could not be
heard.</p>

<p>Soon Ndova began to call for monkeys. His
power of scent or of hearing was so great that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
detected the presence of monkeys, though we could
hear nothing. His calls were soon answered. Then
we made him fast to a cord, for fear that he would go
away from us. Each side kept on talking and answering
each other, and the cries of the flock of monkeys
to which he was talking came nearer and nearer.
Then they suddenly stopped. Had Ndova warned
them not to come nearer? I thought I had detected
a peculiar sound that was unlike those he always uttered
when he wanted ndovas to come. I might be
mistaken, but, after all, they did not come, and we
did not hear them utter a single cry.</p>

<p>We continued on our way. After a while we heard
in the distance the fierce and angry barking of Andekko.
We listened, then shouted at the top of
our voices, "Andekko, Andekko," so that he might
know we were not far from him. He was evidently
not pursuing game, for the barking was stationary.</p>

<p>Rogala said to me: "Let us go through the jungle
towards him and see what causes this fierce barking."</p>

<p>"Yes," said I, "let us go and see what is the matter."</p>

<p>So we left the path, and went through the thick
jungle, breaking some of the branches as we went
along to guide us on our way back.</p>

<p>Louder and louder became Andekko's barking as
we neared the spot where he was, when suddenly the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
barking ceased. The face of Rogala became anxious,
and he said to me in a low voice: "Perhaps Andekko
has been pounced upon by a snake, which is now
coiled round him, and has squeezed him to death."</p>

<p>"That may be so," I replied. "Let us hurry." So
we went, careless of the noise we made. We had
only our dear Andekko in our minds, and we wanted
to save his life, and, if too late, wreak our vengeance
upon his destroyer.</p>

<p>"Dear Andekko," I said to myself, "I think a
great deal of you, for you have been such a faithful
dog, and have rescued us so often from starvation.
I will surely kill the animal that has killed or even
hurt you."</p>

<p>As we approached the spot, I thought I heard a
peculiar noise. I listened. There was no mistake
about it. Andekko was alive, and seemed to be busy
choking some animal or other.</p>

<p>Rogala and I advanced towards the spot, and came
to a dark place in the forest, where a number of big
trees had fallen upon each other. Under all was a
dark recess, a sort of den, and the dog was there.
We shouted "Andekko, Andekko," and he came
out with a small leopard in his mouth. We were
before a leopard's den; both the father and mother
of the cubs had gone in search of prey for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"There is no time to be lost," said Rogala to me.
"I will go into the den and get the leopard's cubs if
Andekko has not killed them all. Watch carefully,
Oguizi, while I am in, and if the leopards come, let
'Bulldog' send them their death-blow."</p>

<p>Rogala had perfect faith in "Bulldog," and believed
in its supernatural powers.</p>

<p>In the meantime Andekko was barking furiously
outside, and it was all we could do to prevent him
from again going inside. If he did, he would surely
kill the rest of the young leopards, if he had not done
so before. I watched carefully while Rogala was getting
within; my eyes were everywhere around; "Bulldog"
was cocked, and I was ready for any sudden
coming of papa and mamma leopard. I felt that I
must be quick in aiming at them in case they made
their appearance together.</p>

<p>In the twinkling of an eye, however, Rogala came
out of the den holding two little live leopards by the
neck. There were two others, he said, that were
dead, and Andekko had had hold of these two.</p>

<p>Rogala looked at me anxiously, and said: "Oguizi,
if the leopards are on their way back with food for
their little ones, we shall have a bad time. Their
anger will be terrible when they see some of their
young dead and torn to pieces, and others missing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
They will scour the forest in search of their enemy.
They move very fast if they have the scent, making
one immense bound after another."</p>

<p>"I will set fire to the leopard's den," I replied;
"there are many dead branches, and the fire will spread
quickly, and the leopards will not know about our
being here." At the same time I lighted a match,
and set fire to a spot where there were many dead
branches and dried leaves. Soon everything was in
a blaze, but in that great and damp forest fires never
spread far. We left the spot, and as soon as we were
in the path we ran as fast as our feet and legs could
carry us towards the river and our island, with visions
of leopards bounding at full speed after us. Once in
a while I could hear the voice of Rogala say: "Go
on, Oguizi, go on!" At other times when I saw
him flagging, I would shout: "Come on, come on,
Rogala!"</p>

<p>I was quite ahead after a while, and as I came in
sight of the river I saw a number of savage-looking
men on our island. I counted twenty of them.
They looked fierce, and their bodies were covered with
war-paint. They carried ugly-looking barbed spears
and shields made of elephant skins. Their leader
walked ahead of them. He was short, and looked
fiercer than the rest. They advanced cautiously, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
suddenly they stopped and looked frightened. They
were looking at my Waterbury clock, and as soon as
they heard the tick-tock they turned suddenly and
fled in great haste towards their canoe. In a jiffy
they left, filled with fear, and paddled away down
the river with the greatest speed. I followed them
with my eyes until they disappeared behind a bend
of the river.</p>

<div class="caption">
"<i>Rogala came out of the den holding two little live
leopards by the neck.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>When Rogala rejoined me, I told him what I had
seen, and he said: "Those people live higher up the
river, and are going to visit their friends."</p>

<p>I drew a long breath of relief as soon as we got
upon our raft, for we did not know but that the leopards
were after us.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rogala said: "I have forgotten the
snake."</p>

<p>"Never mind," I said to him, "we will go after
turtle's eggs."</p>

<p>We had reached the island just in good time, for
soon after we heard the roaring of the leopards. They
had scented us.</p>

<p>Happily the water was between us. Their rage
knew no bounds, for they saw the impassable barrier
between us. I said to Rogala: "Hold one of the
little leopards up by the neck so that they can see
him." Then I fired and succeeded in killing one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the leopards. The other then fled, and we never
heard of it again.</p>

<p>That night I slept with "Bulldog" within my arms,
and rested my head on the belt holding my revolvers
to be ready in case the men we had seen should come
back.</p>

<p>The following day we went into the forest in
search of game, in spite of our fear that the leopard
might still be in the neighborhood. The first thing
we did was to collect berries and nuts for Ndova.
Finding no game, we returned to our island. Ndova
was delighted when we brought him berries. When
he could eat no more, he filled his two pouches to
their full capacity.</p>

TO FIND KOOLA NUTS&mdash;CAMP UNDER THE KOOLA
TREE&mdash;ANOTHER NIGHT IN THE FOREST</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> time had come for us to leave the island and
go back to our camp. I was very much pleased
with our trip. Now I kept the days carefully. We
cooked hard all the turtle's eggs we had and roasted
the fish we had caught. Fish tasted very good, for
we had been so long without it. Rogala loaded the
raft with our outfit. On his return, after landing the
latter, I embarked and bade good-bye to the island
and to the sun, the moon, and the stars.</p>

<p>It was not long before I heard in the distance a
noise like a storm amongst the branches of the trees.
The sound was peculiar. Monkeys were coming towards
me. This noise always proclaimed their approach.
When they came in sight, I saw there was
a troop of about thirty of them; they were ndovas.
On their march onward, they flung themselves from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
branch to branch, travelling with very great speed.
The branch upon which they alighted bent sometimes
ten and fifteen feet under their weight, and rebounded
with great force after they had sprung to another.
Sometimes they were high up in the tree-tops. Then
they descended, to go up higher again. They never
sprang upon a branch that could not rebound, and it
was during the rebound that they leaped to another,
never making a mistake. Their eyes were too quick
to miss their mark. They calculated the distance
they could spring with marvellous accuracy.</p>

<p>They followed their leader, a big fellow, in quick
succession and in silence, and seemed to go four or
five abreast. They used chiefly their arms to grasp
the branches upon which they alighted and their legs
to support themselves. They were so quick in their
motion that my eyes often could not follow the movement
of their limbs. The end of branches often
struck against their faces, but apparently did them no
harm, as they swung in the same direction. So they
went forward, leaving behind them branches of the
trees still swaying for quite a while, filling the forest
with their tremor.</p>

<p>They were travelling parallel with the hunting-path,
and seemed to go at the rate of fifteen miles or
more an hour. Soon they were out of my sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Gradually the noise they made became less and less
and less and then ceased. They were far away. I
continued on my way towards the plantation. After
a few miles I heard the chatter of ndovas, and came
upon a tree upon which they were feeding. They
seemed to be having a great carnival of joy amongst
themselves. I was interested in looking at them,
hidden in a thick bush, and did not wish to kill any,
as we had food enough in the camp. They made
queer faces at each other; the leader would give now
and then a fruit to one of his female companions.</p>

<p>When we got sight of our camp, we looked around
and listened awhile, but nobody was there. We went
after the ladder, climbed it, and soon were within the
enclosure. Ndova's house was just as it was. Rogala's
house for the new moon was intact. The large
stock of firewood we had gathered was all there.
Nothing had been disturbed. Our abode had been
discovered by no one.</p>

<p>Two days after Shinshooko and Alapai returned
loaded with plantains. We were glad to see them
again, and enjoyed the plantains prodigiously.</p>

<p>A few days after our return I went into the forest
in search of game. Towards noon I heard, at some
distance from the path, a noise made by some animal.
I left the path and went in the direction of the noise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The jungle in that part of the forest was not thick,
and I could walk fast.</p>

<p>After a while I saw amidst the trees some black
objects moving ahead of me. At first I thought they
were men, but soon discovered they were nginas. I
hid behind the trunk of a tree and watched them.
There were three nginas. I saw the biggest take a
young tree several inches in diameter, break it in two,
and eat the heart of the wood.</p>

<p>The nginas were not old, and looked extremely
human. They moved away a little further, and
where a fruit called tonda by the natives was growing,
they uttered chuckles of delight at their discovery.
One handed a tonda to one of the others. I was
much afraid they would see me, but after eating the
tondas they moved further off and got into the midst
of some pineapples, which drew from them more guttural
sounds of content. The pineapples disappeared
quickly. They ate at least ten each. Then they
rested and looked at one another.</p>

<p>Before long, however, they became suspicious, and
moved away. I followed in their tracks, but, in my
eagerness to pursue them, I omitted to make marks
of any kind as I went along so that I could find my
way back. It was a great mistake.</p>

<p>Twice I came within sight of the nginas, but inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>vening
branches and overhanging lianas prevented me
from using "Bulldog" and getting a shot at them.
Finally, I gave up the chase. Then I remembered
that during my excitement I had forgotten to mark
the trees in order to find my way back, and soon I
realized that I was lost. I was in a great dilemma,
and I reproached myself for being so careless, and for
not having followed the advice that had been given
me in the forest.</p>

<p>I walked one way, then another, but could see no
traces whatever of where I had been. I was lost,
and the remembrance of my former experience while
hunting with Oshoria, the slaves of King Mombo,
and my other hunters, came vividly before me.</p>

<p>I began to be hungry also. I saw two big koola
trees, but the boars had been there, and eaten all the
nuts that had fallen. I wished I could have had a
peep at these boars, I would have fired at them.
Suddenly down came a nut. I made for it at once.
Then I said to myself: "I will stay under this tree
the rest of the day and camp here to-night, for
probably more nuts will fall during that time." I
looked for water, and found a little rivulet near by,
which confirmed me in thinking this a good place
for a camp.</p>

<p>Another nut fell. I rushed towards it, broke it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
soon the kernel was in my mouth. Then another nut
fell, and another. No sound seemed to me sweeter
than that of the falling of the koola nuts. A strong
wind was evidently blowing, for the tops of the trees
were shaking and the leaves were quivering. "Blow
hard," said I to the wind, "blow hard, for the nuts
will fall."</p>

<p>Listening to the sound of the nuts as they fell
one after another, and putting a lot of wood on the
fire, I lay down to sleep, feeling a great deal better
after my meal.</p>

<p>The next morning I awoke perfectly fresh. During
the day I came to a tolerably well-trodden path, which
was more used than all those I had seen since I had
been in my forest home. But I did not know in
which direction to follow it. Finally, I determined to
follow the right. I walked the rest of the day, but I
found nothing to show me where I was going. I was
very hungry, but the koola nuts had kept me alive,
with the help of water.</p>

<p>I camped again that night in the forest. I put under
my head as a pillow my revolvers, and laid "Bulldog"
by my side.</p>

<p class="i2">PLANTAIN PEELINGS TO EAT&mdash;HUMAN FOOTPRINTS
LEAD ME TO A VILLAGE&mdash;THE VILLAGERS EVIDENTLY
WARLIKE&mdash;ADMITTED WITHIN THE GATE&mdash;AWE
OF THE PEOPLE AT SIGHT OF THE OGUIZI</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Early</span> the next morning I was up, and followed
the path until I came to another which
crossed it. This one was well trodden, showing that it
was quite frequented. The question again arose, which
side must I take. I concluded to take again the
right. Soon after, I discovered some plantain peelings
and the remains of a fire. I was delighted at
the discovery, and stopped and roasted the peelings,
which were better than nothing. I did not like
them, but I was very thankful that I had found them.
Further on I came to a place where the ground was
soft, and saw before me four well-marked human
footprints. Two were much larger than the others,
and were evidently the marks of a full-grown man;
the others looked as if they were those of a woman.</p>

<p>I continued until I came to a place where these two
people had rested. I was overjoyed at this discovery,
for I knew that they were going to some village or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
plantation. Soon after I heard voices. I stopped,
and left the path and hid in the jungle behind a tree,
watching for people to pass. I waited and waited; no
one passed. So I left my hiding-place and returned
to the path. A little further on I heard more voices;
then I left the path again, but I walked parallel with
it and was exceedingly careful, looking around everywhere
constantly. I had learned from the natives to
walk parallel with a path and at some distance from
it in case one does not wish to meet people.</p>

<p>After a while I heard voices again, and this time
many people were talking together. Evidently I was
near an encampment or a village. A village at last
came in sight. The houses had no back doors, and
numerous dead branches of trees were scattered round,
so that it was impossible for any one to come near
without making a noise and so being discovered.
Apparently the people were holding a meeting, for
now and then I could hear a number of voices say,
"Yo, Yo," in token of approval of what the speaker
was saying.</p>

<p>I went carefully round and saw that each end of the
street was closed by a fence made of strong poles
varying in height from twelve to fifteen feet and even
more. At the top of many of the poles were skulls
of wild beasts. Clearly this village belonged to a warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
tribe, whose people were always fighting. In the
middle of the fence was the gate, on each side of which
stood two big idols of human size and representing
two women. How ugly they were! Each had a tongue
of iron coming out of the mouth about six inches
long, sharp as a razor; their eyes were of iron, they
wore big ear-rings of copper of the circumference of
an ordinary plate; both wore head-dresses of brilliant
feathers. Their bodies were painted of different
colors. One held a stick in her hand, which she
was brandishing; the other a snake, which she was
swinging. At their feet were bones of different
animals, talons and heads of eagles, heads of snakes,
and many other things.</p>

<div class="caption">
"<i>Clearly this village belonged to a warlike tribe, whose
people were always fighting</i>."
</div></div>

<p>There was a great noise inside. Soon I heard the
tomtoms beat. They sounded to me very warlike. As
it was getting late, I decided not to enter the village
until the following morning, and retired noiselessly
into the forest at quite a distance from the village,
and after lighting my fires I went to sleep, wondering
what sort of people I was to encounter the
following day.</p>

<p>At daylight I was up, but waited until the day was
more advanced before going to the village. I kept
pondering whether the natives would receive me
well, run away, or show fight. At last I left my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
hiding-place, and a short time afterwards I stood
before the village gate and between the two idols.
I could hear numerous voices in the distance, sometimes
shouts, and the beating of the tomtoms. I
judged that the people belonged to the Bakalai tribe.</p>

<p>Then hearing the voices of two women inside close
to me, I said to them: "Please open the gate to the
Oguizi, who is your friend."</p>

<p>When they heard me, they ran away; but soon
three men came up and talking through the palisades,
asked who I was, for they could not see my face.</p>

<p>I replied: "I am the Oguizi; I come to see you."</p>

<p>When they opened the gate, I found myself in
presence of three fierce-looking fellows, armed with
barbed spears, bows, and poisoned arrows. They were
tall and young and looked like warriors. Closing the
gate behind me, they looked at me with signs of awe,
and one of them said: "Are you the Oguizi who has
come to see the people of the forest?"</p>

<p>I answered, "I am."</p>

<p>It was fortunate that I could talk the Bakalai language.
The three men told me to follow them. As
soon as the villagers got a glimpse of me there was a
great commotion; the meeting was suspended, the
tomtoms beat with greater fury than before, and soon
I found myself surrounded by savage men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>The people formed a great circle, and danced round
me, singing, at the same time taking most beseeching
postures and making invocations to me, asking me to
do them no harm. They acted as if I were an idol.
When they stopped, I learned that the name of the
chief was Penday. I asked to see him. Some of the
men went after him, but came back without him.
He sent the following message to me: How could he
dare to come before the great Oguizi, whom his forefathers
had never seen? He would surely drop dead at
the sight. He knew that I was coming, because for
several nights a gentle wind hovered over the house
where he slept and murmured, "The great Oguizi is
coming! the great Oguizi is coming!" But he sent
word that in three days he would come before me.</p>

<p>Soon after bunches of plantain, two chickens, some
eggs, and a dead monkey were laid at my feet, which
showed that I was welcomed, and then a hut was
given to me that I could occupy by myself.</p>

<p class="i2">ALARM OF MY HUNTERS AT MY ABSENCE&mdash;ROGALA
SETS OUT TO SEARCH FOR ME&mdash;HIS SUPERSTITIOUS
TERRORS&mdash;CONSULTS HIS OGANA, OR IDOL&mdash;FINDS
MY TRACES AT LAST AND FOLLOWS ME TO THE
VILLAGE</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Meantime</span>, as I did not return to our camp,
my hunters became greatly alarmed. They
set off in different directions in the forest in search of
me. Rogala took Andekko with him, thinking that
the dog might scent me, and also Ndova.</p>

<p>He slept in the forest that night, and at daylight
he started again and kept thinking all sorts of things
as he walked along. He wondered if I had left
him for good, and gone back to the moon or vanished
into the air. If so, what would Rotembo say
when he returned without me? He dreaded his
chief's wrath. Then he thought that if I was displeased
with him, all would be over with him, for
I would send all sorts of evil upon him. Such
thoughts crowded upon his mind, one after another.</p>

<p>But soon he said to himself: "How can the Oguizi
be angry with me? Have we not eaten together?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Did he not shake hands with me before he left the
camp? Did he not say, 'Take good care of Ndova
and Andekko'?" These thoughts reassured him,
and gave him new hopes and courage.</p>

<p>After this he seated himself on the ground, took
his ogana out of his bag, and putting it in front of
him, he spoke to her thus: "Ogana, you know how
much I love you; tell me where is the Oguizi. Tell
me if he is angry with me. Please, please, show me
the way in the forest where I can find him. Do,
ogana, do, ogana." Suddenly a smile came over his
face. Ogana had said to him that he would find me.
Then putting back his precious ogana in his bag, he
continued to seek for me with the dog, Andekko,
and Ndova, who stood on his shoulder and now
and then wandered in the forest.</p>

<p>Fears succeeded hopes in spite of his ogana. Had
the Oguizi left him, and seen all he wanted to see in
the big forest, and gone back to the "Land of the
Oguizis"? His superstitious mind began to brood
again. He had the same belief in regard to me that
all the people had, and he was seized with a great fear.
Had I changed shape, and was I wandering in the
forest as an elephant, antelope, leopard, or as a tiny
insect? Perhaps I had taken the shape of a bird and
was following him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>At this thought he looked round to see if he could
discover any birds on the trees near him, and saw
a big one looking down upon him. He was filled
with fear, and said: "Oguizi, if you have taken the
shape of that bird, look into my heart and you will
see that I love you." Then he took some of the
food he had with him, and left a great part of it
for the bird, and continued his way, looking now
and then up at the branches of the trees to see if
the bird was still following him. Then hearing
"Hi-Hi-Hi," a noise made by a peculiar species
of grasshopper, he thought I might have taken that
shape, so I could not be seen by him.</p>

<p>Once more he took his ogana from his bag and
invoked her aid. Still he went on his march in search
of me, his mind perfectly bewildered with different
thoughts. When, lo! to his supreme joy, he discovered
some of the marks I had made upon the bark
of trees, broken off branches, and large heaps of
leaves which I had laid along the path. After this
he discovered that I had left the path and gone
into the forest; and again he lost all traces of me.
He stopped and talked to Andekko and said: "Andekko,
we have lost the Oguizi. Perhaps he is gone
forever. Perhaps he is in the forest. Let us find
him. Help me, Andekko, to find him." Andekko
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
looked into his face and barked. He seemed to
know what Rogala said to him. But soon after this
he found my traces again, and followed them to the
village where I was.</p>

"<i>When I saw him, I came towards him, and in an

</div></div>

<p>Suddenly the villagers heard a voice outside of the
stockade asking: "Is the Oguizi here?"</p>

<p>A number of voices answered: "Yes, the Oguizi is
here with us, and slept in our village last night."</p>

<p>Then they opened the door. The man was Rogala,
followed by Andekko, and having Ndova on his
shoulder. I was at the other end of the street. When
I saw him, I came towards him, and in an instant we
were in each other's arms, to the great astonishment
of the people of the village, who were mute with
wonder at our outburst of friendship. Rogala shouted,
"We are men! we are men!"</p>

<p>Andekko gave vent to barks of joy, leaping round
me, and Ndova jumped from Rogala's shoulder upon
mine, uttering the peculiar sounds which showed his
pleasure in seeing me again.</p>

<p>After we were seated Rogala recounted to me what
I have already told, and at the conclusion of his story
he whispered to me: "Oguizi, I hope you have not
told where we live in the forest." I whispered, "No;"
and after a while the Bakalais crowded round Rogala
and asked him all kinds of questions about me.</p>

UNEXPECTED RETURN</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> Bakalais, like all the people of the great
forest, were very superstitious, and believed in
witchcraft. I found that the people had moved only
a few months before, and that they had abandoned
their former village on this account. Two men had
been "bewitched," and had died within a day of each
other, and this was the cause of the people moving
away. When I arrived, they were holding a great
council to find out who the sorcerers and witches
were, and whether they lived in their village or in
some others.</p>

<p>At sunset the children ceased to play, and the village
became quiet. There arose in the air one of
those mournful, heart-piercing chants,&mdash;a long, sustained
wail of anguish and sorrow. Tears rolled down
the cheeks of the women. "We shall never see An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>guilsi
any more, we shall never see Obindji any more,"
they sang over and over. These were the names of
the two men who had died. They sang for about half
an hour. After a while I saw the people leading
about through the dim light what I thought to be a
naked white man. I could not believe my eyes, but
as he came near me I kept cool and did not show my
astonishment. When he came in front of me I recognized
the man to be a negro albino, for his features,
though his skin was white, were those of a negro.
His hair was woolly, his eyes pinkish.</p>

<p>Later in the evening, an idol, called Makambo, was
brought out into the street, to remain there all night.
It represented a woman, and was of the size of life.
She had cloven feet; her eyes and tongue were of
copper; she wore bracelets around her arms and rings
of copper around her ankles. She had around her
neck a necklace of leopard's claws, and as a pendant
wore the canine of a leopard also. The skin of a snake
was wound around her legs.</p>

<p>That night nobody came out in the street, and nobody
talked in the village, for fear of displeasing
Makambo. The people expected her to talk to
them that night and to give some advice. The
medicine man or the chief of the village interprets
to the people what the idol says.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>Makambo was very much venerated, and during the
night food was put before her. In the morning the
people said that Makambo had nodded her head and
smiled, showing that she was pleased with the offering
of game she had received. But we did not wait to
learn the result of the witchcraft proceedings, and leaving
the Bakalai we found our way back to our camp.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"I am going into the forest," I said to Rogala,
Shinshooko, and Alapai one morning soon after our
return, "to look for new species of birds. Perhaps
I shall find some that I have never seen before. I
do not intend to go far away."</p>

<p>My hunters replied: "We three are going to look
at all the traps we have made to see if they are in
order and if game has been trapped. We are going
to take Andekko and leave Ndova in the camp."</p>

<p>So we all ascended the ladder and wished each other
good luck. Nothing strange happened to me. I
shot no birds, for I had killed before this specimens of
all the species I saw that day, and had stuffed them.</p>

<p>As I approached the camp on my way back, I heard
a great uproar among what I thought was a large troop
of monkeys, to judge by the noise. They were jabbering
away at a great rate, and seemed to be in a great
state of excitement. But to my astonishment I dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>covered
that they were in our camp. What were
they doing there? They were evidently after Ndova.
They had come to pay him a visit. He had manifestly
called them. I walked carefully, and after ascending
the ladder I raised my head above the fence.</p>

<p>The most extraordinary sight was before me. The
monkeys had taken possession of our camp. They
were everywhere, and wandering around in every
direction. They all belonged to the ndova species.
I counted seventeen of them. They had clearly
arrived just a little before me. A number surrounded
Ndova's cage. Some were on the sides,
some on the top. They were talking to Ndova,
who answered them. They were trying to break
the cage. The most eager amongst them was the
leader of the troop, a very big fellow.</p>

<p>It was a sight indeed! I was very glad we had
made Ndova's house so strong. The leader wanted
badly to reach Ndova. He would bite the creepers
that tied the poles together, then stop and talk to
Ndova, then go to work again.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I could not see what Ndova was doing
inside; was he also trying to break his cage and
go to the monkeys? I watched silently; but I
began to fear that the cage would gradually be broken
by the big monkey. So I gave a heavy cough. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
this all the monkeys looked around. The big male,
their leader, gave a peculiar cry of alarm. In an instant
they were all over the fence and among the trees.
Soon after I heard them utter loud calls, which Ndova
answered. Then all became silent, and after a while I
heard the branch of a tree near the palisade bend
under the weight of a monkey that had come back.
I looked up and saw a very big monkey. He was
the leader, and easily recognized by his large size,
for he was much bigger than all the others. He
began to talk to our monkey, who answered him; then
he jumped down upon another branch, and I saw him
scale the palisade and get on the top of Ndova's house,
and just as he was beginning to try to break into it,
I gave a great shout, and the big fellow, in three bounds,
fled outside the camp. A short time afterwards he
came back again, this time very slyly, and I saw him
only when he came over the palisade. I fired a gun.
He uttered a shrill cry of fright, fled once more, and
never came back.</p>

<p>When my hunters returned, I told them what had
happened. After I had finished, Rogala said: "The
leader of the troop wanted Ndova to go away with
him."</p>

<p>The following day I took Ndova with me into the
forest and loosed him. He followed me closely, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
I was suddenly startled by his calling monkeys. He
was answered at once by the big voice of one of his
species. Then I saw Ndova go from tree to tree in the
direction of the troop of the ndovas as fast as he could.
I shouted, "Ndova, Ndova," but he did not heed my
voice and disappeared amongst the trees. I went
after him, and after a while I heard a strange racket
among the monkeys. They were evidently welcoming
Ndova, and were expressing their feelings by
different sounds or words of their own.</p>

<p>I gave up Ndova, and was returning to the camp
with a sad heart, when all at once I heard a rustling
of branches over my head and then a chuckle. It was
Ndova. I called him, and soon after he was on my
shoulders grinning. I said: "Ndova, you won't catch
me again letting you entirely free in the forest. After
this you will be tied to a cord when you go out with
me." But I had no cord with me then, so I had to
leave him to himself. He did not run away, however,
and we reached the camp together.</p>

<p>When the men returned in the evening I told them
how afraid I had been that we had lost Ndova.</p>

<p>"Yes," they said; "hereafter he must be tied and
always led by a rope."</p>

appearance that we knew he had found nothing.

left from the wounds he has received fighting wild
animals are more conspicuous than ever."</p>

<p>He was indeed a sight. The dear old fellow
seemed to know that I was talking of him, as he
had heard his name, and was looking at me and wagging
his tail all the time I was speaking. I fancied
he was saying to me: "Let us leave this place. It is
no good. There is no game here. Can't you see
how thin I am?"</p>

<p>Looking at Ndova, I said to Rogala: "Ndova is
much better off than Andekko. He is not so thin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Would you take a knife and kill our friend Ndova,
who has been so often the cause of our getting food,
thus preventing us from starving?"</p>

<p>Then I recounted one by one all the different times
Ndova and Andekko had saved us from hunger or
starvation and said: "Rogala, Ndova and Andekko
have been faithful to us. We shall be faithful to
them, and if we get food we will divide it amongst
all of us."</p>

<p>All the time I was thinking what to do to relieve
our hunger. We were in desperate straits. Suddenly
I said: "Rogala, I have found food."</p>

<p>At my words Rogala brightened up. "Where is
the food?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"There," I said, pointing to my bed. He glanced
there, but there was no food to be seen, and he looked
disappointed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Rogala," I persisted, "there is food on my
bed."</p>

<p>Two antelope skins which we had stretched and
dried lay on my bed. I had intended to make shoes,
leggings, and trousers with them. But, pointing to
the two skins, I said: "We will boil these skins and
eat them. That will keep us all from starving until
we find game."</p>

<p>Rogala's eyes were now full of life and hope. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wondered why I had not thought of this before. So
we made preparations at once for a meal. We cut
off a part of one of the antelope skins, and poured
hot water upon the hair and scraped and washed it
afterwards. Then we cut the skin into very small
pieces, and boiled these until they became quite soft,
after which, as a relish, we added some salt and some
red pepper&mdash;I could hardly eat anything without
pepper. When ready, we poured the contents into
a wooden dish. This done, we sat around it, Andekko
standing by us and waiting with eager eyes
for his share of the boiled skin. We thought the
food was not bad, for we were famished.</p>

<p>After the meal I said: "Men, these two antelope
skins will furnish us food for three or four days, and
that will give us time to find game and nuts." We
felt much stronger after our meal.</p>

<p>The following day Shinshooko and Alapai went to
look after the traps to see if any animals had been
caught. Rogala and I went into the forest with
Ndova and Andekko.</p>

<p>After a long walk Ndova uttered the sounds made
by his species&mdash;the white-nosed monkeys or ndovas.
They answered his call; we could hear them coming
towards us. Rogala immediately tied Ndova with a
rope and held him fast. Then we hid under a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
tree with thick foliage. Soon the monkeys were
above our heads talking to Ndova, who answered
them. We stood still, then moved carefully out of
our hiding-place, having in the meantime made
Ndova fast to a branch of the tree. We took aim,
fired, and two big monkeys fell dead almost upon
our heads.</p>

<p>Rogala gave a grim look of satisfaction. Then
looking at the two monkeys, I said to Rogala: "Look
at what Ndova has done for us. Without him we
should be without food and starving."</p>

<p>We could not wait until we returned to the camp.
We lighted a big fire, cut one of the monkeys in two,
and roasted it. So we had a good meal, and gave a
lot to Andekko.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing that evening in the camp
round the roast half of one of the monkeys. Alapai,
who had discovered a cluster of trees with nuts,
brought a number of tondas, berries and fruits; so
Ndova had also a feast.</p>

<p class="i2">I FIND STRANGE FOOTPRINTS ON THE BANKS OF A
RIVULET&mdash;ROGALA AND I SET OFF IN PURSUIT&mdash;WE
FIND A MAN UNDER A KOOLA TREE&mdash;SURPRISE
AND CAPTURE HIM&mdash;TERROR OF OUR CAPTIVE&mdash;WE
TAKE HIM TO CAMP AND DISCOVER
HE IS A CANNIBAL</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">One</span> day I had not walked two hours when I
was startled by the discovery of two human
footprints on the banks of a little rivulet. They
looked so fresh that I thought the man had been
there but a short time before me. I looked around,
but saw no one, and heard nothing. I held one of
my revolvers ready to fire at sight.</p>

<p>I hurried back to the camp and told Rogala of my
discovery. He listened attentively, and then said with
much earnestness: "I wonder if the Bakalais of the
village we left have sent a spy to see where we live
and learn what we are doing."</p>

<p>"No fear of that, Rogala," I said; "no Bakalai
would dare to follow the Oguizi. The man is either
an elephant hunter or a runaway slave, or a man who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
has fled from his tribe or village on being accused
of witchcraft."</p>

<p>Rogala got up and went for his gun; then he said:
"Oguizi, let us go in search of that man. We must
capture him, for who knows but he may have discovered
our camp?"</p>

<p>Taking "Bulldog" with me, we started, Rogala
whispering to me, as we went along, the well-known
caution: "Let us not make more noise than a leopard
in search of prey, or a fish swimming."</p>

<p>We came to the little stream where I had seen the
footprints. Rogala said to me, after he had looked at
them: "This man has taken this rivulet as a path,
and followed the water."</p>

<p>With these words he did the same thing. I followed,
and we waded down with the current. We had not
walked more than one hour when Rogala gave a low
click and pointed with his finger to a particular
spot near a big tree. Looking in that direction, I saw
a man under a koola tree picking up some of the nuts
that had fallen on the ground, breaking them with
a stone, and eating them voraciously. He had evidently
been starving.</p>

<p>We hid behind a tree, and watched silently the
movements of the stranger. We did not dare to
whisper for fear of being heard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>Rogala, who was about two yards from me, came to
my side, and made a sign to move away further. He
was very much excited. His forehead was covered
with perspiration. When we were at a safe distance,
he whispered: "This man is not a Bakalai; he is
from a far country. I think he has run away from
his people. Let us surprise him, and if he runs away
from us I will shoot at him and kill him."</p>

<p>I saw by the looks of Rogala that he was in earnest.</p>

<p>"No, Rogala," I replied, "we must not kill him if
he runs away, but try to capture him. Then we shall
find out where he comes from, and how far off his
country is. As soon as we come near him we will
shout to him to stand still. I will fire 'Bulldog,'
and if he has never heard a gun fired in his life he
will be so scared that he will not move. If he runs
away, we will run after him. We are good runners,
we can go quickly through the jungle. Now let
us crawl towards him; you keep on his right, I on
his left."</p>

<p>We walked so carefully that not one of our steps
could be heard. Rogala once moved towards me just
to whisper: "Oguizi, he must not escape from us."</p>

<p>We saw that the man had a bag of poisoned arrows
hanging by his side, and on the ground lay his bow.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer we came to the stranger, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
was busy breaking the koola nuts, when suddenly
he turned round and looked in our direction. Fortunately
we crouched in time by a fallen tree. Had he
heard us? We peeped above the tree. No, for
he again began to crack koola nuts, and was putting
the kernels in a little bag. We were within ten
yards of him.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without a word of warning, Rogala
jumped up, crossed the stream, and uttered a terrific
war-cry, running towards the man. When I saw this,
I fired "Bulldog" and ran also towards him. The
poor fellow seemed to be spellbound and unable to
get up. As we came up to him, he took hold of
Rogala's feet, which meant that he put himself under
his protection, and looked at me with great terror.
He trembled all over, and could not utter a word.</p>

<p>I looked at him and smiled, but this did not seem
to reassure him. Rogala spoke to him in several languages
that he had learned from other slaves, but our
prisoner shook his head to show that he did not
understand. Then I spoke to him in several of the
languages I had learned, but he understood me no
better. Thereupon we made signs to try to find out
from where he came. At this he looked up, trying to
see from the light where the sun was. Then he
pointed in the direction of the east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must be from a far-off country," I said to
Rogala, "for he seems not to understand any of the
languages we have spoken to him."</p>

<p>Our captive was tall, and emaciated from hunger.
His teeth were filed sharp to a point, and gave him a
very savage appearance. Every part of his body except
his legs was tattooed all over. On his stomach
was the representation of a crocodile, showing that he
must have lived on the shore of a lake or of a river.
Upon his cheeks were spots of the size of large peas.
His forehead was also tattooed.</p>

<p>"We must be very watchful," said Rogala; "perhaps
the man understands some of the languages we
spoke to him, after all."</p>

<p>Then he broke the man's bow, and buried his bag
of poisoned arrows in the ground, for fear that man or
beast would be hurt by them.</p>

<p>Our prisoner was very much frightened when he
saw this, and looked at me with imploring eyes. He
had divined instinctively that I was the master; his
looks seemed to say: "Do not kill me!"</p>

<p>After a pause I said: "Rogala, if our prisoner tries
to run away, let us spare his life and not shoot him;
every man tries to run away from the people he fears
in search of liberty. You would do likewise if Rotembo
were not a good master."</p>

<div class="caption">
"<i>Suddenly Rogala uttered a terrible war-cry and ran
towards the man</i>."
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Rogala looked at me in blank astonishment, and
then said: "Oguizi, I will not try to kill him if he
runs away; but," he added, "he must not run away."</p>

<p>We let our prisoner crack more koola nuts, and
waited until his appetite was satisfied; then we started
for our camp, our captive walking between Rogala,
who led, and myself in the rear. Rogala had taken
the precaution to tie his hands behind his back before
starting. We walked silently, not one of us uttering
a word until we came to our palisade. Our captive
then showed signs of great fear.</p>

<p>I told Rogala to go over first and tie Andekko, for
I was sure the dog would try to bite him. When we
were all inside, we gave our prisoner a good warm
meal of plantains&mdash;a few of which still remained&mdash;and
a piece of monkey. Rogala washed his body
with warm water and then rubbed it with oil, for his
skin was dried and parched; he seemed very grateful.
Soon he fell asleep on the bare ground.</p>

<p>Looking at him as he slept, I said to Rogala: "The
poor fellow may have been days and weeks in the
forest subsisting on nuts, berries, and fruit when he
could find them, avoiding all the time the paths for fear
of coming in contact with people. For you know,"
I continued, "that as soon as a man is out of his
country, and comes out of his circle of friends belong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>ing
to another tribe, he is sure to be captured and
made a slave."</p>

<p>"That is true," replied Rogala. "To-morrow
morning we will try to learn something about him."</p>

<p>Andekko did not take kindly to our new-comer,
and growled at him all the time. We agreed to
watch in turn over the captive during the night, as
his bonds were not very strong. We lighted several
fires round him, and tied Andekko for fear that he
might bite him.</p>

<p>When I awoke in the morning, I saw that he was
still asleep, Andekko watching him and growling at
him now and then. I looked for Rogala, but he was
not there. I wondered where he had gone. Soon
after I heard an axe. Rogala was cutting down a tree.
After a while all became silent, and Rogala appeared before
me and told me that he had cut two logs. After
he had brought these inside, Rogala went to work on
a "nchogo," and I guessed at once that it was to keep
our prisoner captive and prevent him from running
away. The nchogo is composed of two logs with
holes,&mdash;the larger one to imprison the feet, the
smaller for the hands.</p>

<p>The poor fellow was very much frightened when he
saw the nchogo. He knew that it was for him.
When I saw this, I said to Rogala: "This man belongs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
to a tribe living in the great forest, for he knows what
a nchogo is. In a barren or prairie country they have
no trees to make nchogos of. But we must treat our
prisoner gently, give him plenty of food to show him
that we care for him and that we are his friends. Then
in a few days, after he has got accustomed to us, we will
free him from the nchogo."</p>

<p>That day we gave him three meals, and ate by his
side, and he saw that we had the same food.</p>

<p>When evening came, I said: "Rogala, you will go
to sleep while I watch."</p>

<p>Soon both Rogala and our prisoner were asleep.
Towards two o'clock I awoke Rogala for the watch
and went to sleep myself.</p>

<p>In the morning I said: "Rogala, let us think over
and see if you and I have spoken to our prisoner all
the languages and dialects we know."</p>

<p>So we began to think, and finally Rogala said: "I
did not speak to him in the Osheba language."</p>

<p>"Why," said I, "do you think he is a cannibal?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps he is," he replied.</p>

<p>Rogala spoke to him then in Osheba, and had uttered
but a few words when the man's face brightened
up, for he found that we should be able to understand
him. He was a cannibal. There was no doubt
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>Several days passed by. We got along very well
with our captive, although he was kept in stocks. He
seemed contented with his lot. He found that we
treated him otherwise like one of ourselves. He ate
with us, and consequently had the same food. When
food was very scarce, we divided it equally among us,
but of course when we had only nuts or berries he
had only these to eat, and if we were hungry he had
to go hungry also.</p>

<p>Several times I proposed to Rogala to take him out
of the nchogo, but Rogala was always unwilling.
Thinking that he was wiser than I in this matter,
as he knew the native character better than I did, I
let him have his own way.</p>

<p>We had given the name of Akenda-Mbani ("never
go twice to the same place") to our prisoner, for we
knew that he would never go back to his own country.</p>

<p>One afternoon Shinshooko and Alapai made their
appearance, bringing with them four elephants' tusks.
They had found two elephants in the pits they had
dug in the forest for the purpose of entrapping the
huge beasts.</p>

<p>They were very much astonished when they saw
Akenda-Mbani and we told them how we had captured
him.</p>

IN SPITE OF ALL OUR CARE AND NURSING&mdash;ONE
MORNING I FIND HIM DEAD&mdash;WE MAKE A COFFIN
FOR HIM AND BURY HIM IN THE FOREST</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> following morning, to my astonishment and
no small consternation, Ndova was ill, and
refused to eat the berries and nuts given to him, of
which ordinarily he was very fond. He looked at
them, but would not even take them in his hands.
His body was hot, and it was evident that he had
a high fever. His heart beat very fast. It was
very strange, I thought; he had been so well the
evening before.</p>

<p>I said to Rogala: "I wonder if Ndova could have
been stung by a scorpion or a centipede during the
night, or perhaps a small poisonous snake entered his
house and bit him when he tried to play with it."</p>

<p>"No," said Rogala, "monkeys are like people;
they are afraid of snakes and do not play
with them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>I took Ndova on my knees and examined his
body, on which I discovered a red spot, showing
that he had been stung either by a scorpion or a
centipede.</p>

<p>"Look!" I said to Rogala, pointing out the place
to him. "Ndova has been stung by a scorpion
or a centipede."</p>

<p>"It is so," replied Rogala.</p>

<p>There are two or three species of centipedes and
scorpions; the very poisonous ones are dark red,
almost black. Rogala looked carefully at the red
spot, and then said in a thoughtful and sad voice: "I
am afraid it is all over with Ndova, for we black men
die of the sting of this bad kind of scorpion and centipede,
or else, if we escape, we are very ill. Their
stings are often as dangerous as the bites of poisonous
snakes."</p>

<p>I immediately gave a little dose of medicine to
Ndova, but it did not seem to do him any good. That
night we all went to sleep feeling very sad.</p>

<p>At break of day I went to Ndova to see how he was.
I said, "Good-morning, Ndova," but he remained
quiet in his little house. He did not come out, as he
had always done before, and jump on my shoulder, and
give a chuckle, which probably meant in the monkey
language of the ndova tribe, "I am glad to see you."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Instead of the chuckle I heard an indistinct sound,
and he looked at me in a forlorn way as if to say, "I
am very ill."</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="food"><img src="images/i_228.png" width="500"
height="740" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>He ate with us, and consequently had the same food</i>."
</div></div>

<p>I felt his body. It was hotter than the day before,
and his pulse beat so quickly that I felt he could not
live much longer.</p>

<p>I shouted to Rogala: "Ndova is very, very ill;
come and look at him;" and he came.</p>

<p>"Truly," he said, "Ndova is very, very ill indeed."</p>

<p>"If Ndova dies," I said, "we lose a very good
friend who has been invaluable to us in this forest.
Never shall we get another monkey as intelligent."</p>

<p>In the course of a few days poor Ndova had grown
so thin that we could hardly recognize him. His
eyes had entirely lost their mischievous expression,
and could only give us a blank look. I put a
little jacket on him which I made out of a woollen
shirt. I made a little bed, shaking the leaves
thoroughly, and laid him upon it, and covered him
with what was left of the woollen shirt. Then I
said: "Ndova, I am going into the forest to get
berries for you."</p>

<p>When I returned I put some berries before his lips,
but his mouth did not open to eat them. "Eat these,
Ndova," I said to him; but he only answered me by
a look. Before dark I went to say good-night to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
him, but he had not the strength to move his arms,
which were under his little blanket. I tucked him
in, and while I was doing so, his eyes looked at me in
a blank sort of way. I said to him: "Dear Ndova,
I wish you could know how much we think of you,
and how we shall miss you if you die."</p>

<p>"I do not think we shall find Ndova alive to-morrow
morning," I said to Rogala, who was by
my side.</p>

<p>I went to bed with a heavy heart, thinking how
many times Ndova had rescued us from hunger and
perhaps starvation. I awoke several times during the
night, and each time I got up and went to see if Ndova
was dead. His life was ebbing away, his pulse was
very low, but he still breathed.</p>

<p>In the morning I found Ndova dead. He looked
as if he were asleep under his blanket. I shouted to
Rogala: "Ndova is dead." Then we stood mournfully
by his side, and Rogala said with a sad voice:
"Ndova will follow us no more in the forest."</p>

<p>We cut a big log, split it in two, and dug a big
hole inside. This was to be the coffin of Ndova, and
we laid his body in it.</p>

<p>After this we dug a grave at the foot of a tree near
Rogala's house and collected stones. When everything
was ready, Rogala and I carried the coffin to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
grave, followed by Shinshooko, Alapai, and Akenda-Mbani.</p>

<p>With my knife I carved upon the bark the following
inscription:</p>

<p class="p2 center">HERE LIES NDOVA<br />
OUR FRIEND</p>

<p class="p2">Then we put the coffin into the grave, covered it
with earth, and surrounded it by stones. My hunters
and I hardly spoke to each other that day.</p>

OF THE DOG&mdash;SOUNDS OF A FIERCE
CONFLICT&mdash;I FIND ANDEKKO FIGHTING WITH A
MANDRILL&mdash;HE KILLS HIS ENEMY, BUT DIES OF HIS
WOUNDS&mdash;BURIED IN THE FOREST</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">We</span> felt very lonely after the death of Ndova.
But, alas! his loss was not to prove our only
misfortune. I went one day alone into the forest and
took Andekko with me. After walking three or four
miles I came to a part of the forest where there was
no jungle. Such tracts are often found, especially
where water has been long standing during the rainy
season. I walked consequently noiselessly, looking
carefully all around me as I went.</p>

<p>Andekko had disappeared in search of game. After
a while I saw three large mandrills, the largest I had
ever seen, walking away from me. Mandrills of that
size are very formidable animals and have terrible
canines. They were out of sight, and I had been
unable to shoot at them, as trees were in my way.</p>

<p>I kept on, nevertheless, when I was suddenly startled
by the fierce barking of Andekko. Then I heard a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
howl of pain from him, followed immediately by a
shrill shriek from an animal which I thought must be
one of the mandrills I had seen. I hurried as fast as
I could towards the place whence the cries came, and
once more I heard the fierce barking of Andekko.</p>

<p>I was not mistaken. When I reached him, as I
soon did, Andekko had pinned the mandrill down
and they were fighting savagely. Andekko was covered
with blood. One of his ears hung limp. He
had a terrible gash in his back, and part of his lower
lip was badly cut. The mandrill's teeth had made sad
havoc with poor Andekko.</p>

<p>But the mandrill lay underneath him on the ground,
the blood flowing from his neck profusely. Andekko's
teeth had probably bitten through the jugular
vein. But what big teeth the mandrill had! When
he saw me, he uttered a piercing cry. I shouted to
Andekko again and again, but he did not heed my
voice in the least. He glared with rage, and his hair
stood up straight on his back. Nothing could have
made him give up his prey. He had hold of the
mandrill in such manner that the latter could not bite
him. They rolled on the ground on the top of each
other. Andekko clung fast. The mandrill tried with
his feet to push Andekko off, and uttered scream after
scream. But before long he stopped, and at last all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
became silent. The neck of the mandrill had been torn
to pieces. The rage of Andekko was so great that it
took me quite a while to make him loose his hold.</p>

<p>The mandrill was dead, but poor Andekko was
a terrible sight. I said to him: "Andekko, you are a
brave and fearless dog." Then I tore some strips
from my shirt and bandaged his wounds to stop their
bleeding. He had great difficulty in following me,
he was so weak. I walked very slowly. At last we
reached the camp, and it was hard to make him go
through the aperture made in the fence for him to go
out and come in at. My hunters had returned, and
we all felt sorry for poor Andekko. He seemed
utterly dejected. We made a bed of dry leaves for
him to lie upon, and boiled some monkey meat for
him. But when it was done and offered to him, he
refused it. Poor Andekko had the fever, like Ndova,
and, like Ndova, he lingered but a short time. We
made a grave for him outside of the camp at the foot
of a tree, and we buried him there.</p>

<p>I cut upon the bark with my knife:</p>

<p class="i2">OUR PROVISIONS FAIL&mdash;ATTACKED AGAIN BY BASHIKOUAYS&mdash;RELEASE
OF AKENDA-MBANI FROM HIS
FETTERS&mdash;HE PROVES A GOOD TRAPPER&mdash;"GOUAMBA"&mdash;MY
WAKING VISIONS&mdash;ANOTHER HUNTING
EXPEDITION&mdash;WE KILL TWO MONKEYS, THEN STARVE
AGAIN</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Berries</span> and nuts had become very scarce and
we had to go a long way to gather them, for
those that were near our camp had been eaten. Game
had also become very scarce. One day we all set
out for the depths of the forest together. Before
leaving the camp we made signs to Akenda-Mbani
that we were going after food, by opening our mouths
and drawing our stomachs in, to show that they
were empty. He evidently understood us, for he
smiled.</p>

<p>"If we fail to find food," said Rogala, "it will be
on account of witchcraft; yes," he shouted, "it will
be on account of witchcraft. I have always suspected
Okambi of being a sorcerer, and it will be his witchcraft
that will cause our starving."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sh-sh-sh, Rogala," said I, "if you speak so loud
you will scare the game." The very thought of witchcraft
had made Rogala forget himself.</p>

<p>Though we walked all day, we found no nuts or
berries of any consequence. The season of the koola
nuts was nearly over, and the wild boars had been
under the trees we knew. We saved some of such
nuts and berries as we found, however, for Akenda-Mbani.</p>

<p>Suddenly we were attacked by the dreaded bashikouay
ants and had to flee for camp. "Let us hurry
as fast as we can, Rogala," said I, "for Akenda-Mbani
is in nchogo, and if the bashikouays pass that way he
is sure to be devoured by them, and we may only see
his skeleton on our arrival."</p>

<p>We hurried back as fast as our legs could carry us,
and it was a good thing that we returned. Otherwise
we should surely have found only the skeleton of
Akenda-Mbani, as I had said, for we had not been at
home an hour before the bashikouays made their
appearance.</p>

<p>Fortunately we were ready to receive them. In a
number of places within our enclosure firewood had
been piled up and was all ready to be lighted. Water
was boiling in all the pots we had, and we had plenty
of hot ashes. The smoke prevented the bashikouays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
from ascending the trees, and we spread hot ashes
wherever they appeared.</p>

<p>After this I said to Rogala: "We must take
Akenda-Mbani out of the nchogo. I do not care
whether he runs away or not. I do not want his
death on my head or on yours. The Oguizi wishes
nobody to die. Just think what a narrow escape he
had! If he had been eaten up by the bashikouays,
it would have been our fault. It will never do to
keep a man in nchogo unless some one is near
to watch him."</p>

<p>"You are right, Oguizi. It is so; it is so,"
he repeated half a dozen times. Then he added
thoughtfully: "Yes, when people have been discovered
to be wizards, they are tied to a tree when
the bashikouays are in the neighborhood, and in a
short time nothing is left of them but their bones."</p>

<p>So Rogala and I took Akenda-Mbani out of his
nchogos, first freeing his hands, and then his feet.</p>

<p>I felt now quite happy, for Akenda-Mbani was free,
and if we had been sure of him at first he would not
have been placed in nchogo at all. He was now one
of us. The next day we all went again into the forest
in search of firewood, and without being told to do so,
Akenda took a heavy load on his back, and carried it
to the camp. The day following, he went into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
forest by himself, and set traps for game, coming back
with a porcupine and a pangolin or ant-eater. So
plenty was in the camp once more for the moment.
The porcupine meat is very good, the pangolin's was
very strong.</p>

<p>But when these were eaten, no more game was
trapped, and we again boiled some of the antelope
skin.</p>

<p>I had such a "gouamba"&mdash;that is, such a longing
for meat&mdash;that the nuts and the boiled antelope skin
became loathsome to me. I ate them just as a
man would eat, day after day, bread soaked in water.</p>

<p>What a fearful meaning there is, I said to myself,
"in that native word 'gouamba'!" I spent hours in
a sort of waking dream in which I fancied that I had
returned home, and had met many friends, one after
another, as I walked about the streets. The first one
would say: "Hello, is that you, Paul? Welcome home.
Won't you dine with me to-day? My wife and
children will be so glad to see you back again. We
have roast beef to-night."</p>

<p>Then, in a moment, I found myself at the family
table. A big, juicy piece of roast beef was before my
eyes on the table. I saw my friend cut the roast beef.
A big piece was served to me. I was then asked if I
would have sweet potatoes, corn, and other vegetables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
I could see the smoke rise from these hot dishes.
How I enjoyed the pudding and the ice-cream at the
end of the dinner!</p>

<p>I went out and met another friend who also asked me
to dinner. This one had turkey instead of roast beef.
How I looked at the turkey! It had been roasted to
a nicety, and was a rich brown all over. Then my
friend asked: "Paul, which piece do you like best?"
To which I answered: "I have no choice." Then a
large piece was put on a plate for me with the stuffing.
The waitress would pass the cranberry sauce, then the
potatoes and the green peas. How good all these
tasted! Then came the strawberries and the ice-cream.
Then more dinners, with other friends.
How I enjoyed these in my imagination! Then
hunger would stop, and then come back with ten times
greater force. We drank as much water as we could,
for there is nourishment in water.</p>

<p>Akenda-Mbani went to look after his traps one day,
and Rogala and I went hunting. We were in desperate
straits. We had gone quite a distance from the
camp, and had seen nothing, when suddenly I thought
I heard something in the distance. I gave a "click."
As soon as Rogala heard it he stopped and then came
to my side. I had heard, as I thought, monkeys
leaping from tree to tree. We stood still, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
noise became gradually louder. The monkeys were
evidently coming in our direction. Hope of food
loomed before our eyes. Then all became silent;
the monkeys had manifestly stopped upon some fruit-bearing
trees, and were feeding. At such times they
are always still, for they do not want to attract the
attention of other monkeys.</p>

<p>We went in the direction where we thought they
were, looking at the tops of the trees as we went along.
After a while we heard nuts falling on the ground.
Soon we came under the tree, and pulp and seeds
fell upon our heads and all around us. Looking up,
we saw the monkeys. I counted seventeen of them;
they were nkagos, and were so busy eating that they
did not notice us.</p>

<p>We picked out two of the biggest, aimed at them
carefully, and fired. They fell on the ground with a
great crash. In the meantime the troop gave a shrill
cry of fear and decamped with the utmost speed, and
for a long time afterwards we could hear the noise
of the branches as they rose again after the monkeys
had leaped to others. When they thought they were
far from danger, they stopped and uttered the peculiar
nkago cry, calling upon their missing companions;
but no answer came back to them, for our two monkeys
were stone dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>They kept calling again and again, however, for
a time; then at last we heard nothing more. We
swung the monkeys over our backs, and had regained
the hunting path leading towards our camp, when I
thought I heard a slight noise on a tree. I looked
up, thinking a bird had made it, when to my surprise
I saw a monkey looking down upon us. He was a
nkago, and was following his dead mate, and looking
down upon her in deep silence. I could see his
human-like eyes watching us. He had wondered
why his call had not been answered by her, had left
the troop to seek her, and then seen her lifeless form
on the back of Rogala. He seemed to know that
something was wrong. I would have given a good
deal to know his thoughts.</p>

<p>We continued on our way. The monkey kept
following us, watching, peeping down upon us
and upon his dead mate. When we stopped, he
stopped, his eyes always looking down upon us. I
see them still to this day. I was so sorry I had
killed his mate. I noticed that he never jumped
from one limb of a tree to another, but crept along
their trunks and branches, evidently wishing to make
no noise to attract attention. He followed us to
our camp. I could not tell why, but I did not feel
like eating monkey that evening, for I thought I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
had never in an animal seen eyes with such a human
expression. The next morning I saw him for an instant;
he was still looking for his mate. But that
was my last glimpse of him. He probably went
back to his troop.</p>

<p class="i2">DECIDE TO BREAK UP OUR CAMP AND RETURN&mdash;ARRIVAL
AT ROGALA'S HOME&mdash;I MAKE MYSELF A
PAIR OF SKIN TROUSERS&mdash;DEPARTURE FOR ROTEMBO'S
VILLAGE&mdash;OUR GRAND RECEPTION AND
SUCCEEDING FESTIVITIES&mdash;ROTEMBO'S PROMISE&mdash;FAREWELL</p>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">The</span> monkey meat did not last more than two
days. Then food became as scarce as before.
We had clearly exhausted that part of the forest.</p>

<p>"The times are hard with us," I said to Rogala;
"the bashikouays have driven the game away. There
are no more koola nuts. Let us go back to your
home, where we shall find plenty of plantain and
cassava."</p>

<p>Rogala agreed readily to my proposal. The two
following days we rested and made preparations for
our departure. I was very glad to return to the
home of my hunters. My clothes were in tatters;
hardly anything was left of my trousers; I had
worn out all my shoes; my old panama hat was
a sight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Joyfully we left our old forest camp, and after an
uneventful journey we reached the home of my
hunters. It was time indeed. How well I slept in
my little hut that night! All the things I had left
behind were exactly in the same place. No one had
touched them.</p>

<p>I had saved skins of the gazelles we had killed, and
I sewed them together first; then I took what was left
of my trousers and put them on the skins and marked
out the pattern with charcoal. Then I cut up the
skins and sewed with my big needle, and at the end
of the day I had made a pair of skin trousers. I also
covered my old shoes with gazelle skin.</p>

<p>When I had furnished myself with something to
wear, we prepared to return to Chief Rotembo. All
my hunters and Akenda-Mbani were to accompany
me. Many bunches of plantain were collected; the
men went hunting and killed an antelope for Rotembo,
and the following morning we left, one canoe
loaded with the skins and bones of the animals I had
killed and with the birds I had stuffed.</p>

<p>After a pleasant trip down the Ogobai, we arrived at
the village of Rotembo amid the firing of guns and
the beating of the tomtoms.</p>

<p>The news quickly spread that the Oguizi had
returned, and many people came flocking to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
village. Canoe after canoe was to be seen coming
from up or down the river all the time.</p>

<div class="figcentern6"><a name="trousers"><img src="images/i_248.png" width="500"
height="803" alt="" title="" /></a>
<div class="caption">
"<i>At the end of the day I had made a pair of skin trousers.</i>"
</div></div>

<p>Then a great meeting took place. Rotembo was
dressed in state, and made a great speech, saying how
much he loved me. The crowd shouted, "Great is
Rotembo, the friend of the Oguizi! Great is the
Oguizi!" Tomtoms beat and guns were fired.</p>

<p>Then I arose, and in the midst of a profound silence
I made a speech. "Rotembo," I said, "I love you
and your people. When I was hungry you gave me
food; when I was thirsty you gave me water. You
gave me shelter and nothing was stolen from me."
At these words a great shout of joy arose. The tomtoms
beat furiously, and more guns were fired.</p>

<p>"You gave me Rogala, your faithful slave," I continued;
"I bring him back to you. There are Shinshooko
and Alapai also, your faithful slaves, who love
you. They with their wives and children have been
kind to me. There is Akenda-Mbani, whom we
found in the forest. Now, Rotembo, you are my
friend." (All shouted, "He is your friend!")
"Never let one of these men or their wives be sold."</p>

<p>"I will never sell them," cried Rotembo.</p>

<p>Then the great meeting broke up. Rotembo and his
people drank a great quantity of fermented drinks they
had made to celebrate my return. There was a grand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
ball which lasted all night. Rotembo himself danced,
and came before me singing and dancing in the midst
of vociferous cheers by the people.</p>

<p>The next day I prepared a great feast that Rotembo
and I were to eat together. The bottom of our canoe
was to be our table. Rogala, Shinshooko, Alapai, and
Akenda-Mbani were seated at a table close to ours.
Rotembo's wives waited upon us. A mass of people
formed a great circle round us, and looked at us, and
one of them said: "The great Oguizi loves also
Rogala and Shinshooko, Alapai and Akenda-Mbani."</p>

<p>In the evening I called my hunters together, and
gave each a new gun, powder, and some iron bars. I
gave them beads for their wives also, and the next day
I accompanied them to their canoe and bade them
good-bye. They felt sad to leave me, and as they
embarked, Rogala said: "Oguizi, come again to see us
at our plantation."</p>

<p>The people believed that I had killed Andekko and
Ndova to take them with me, and wondered why I
had not killed my hunters to take them with me also.
"When they die," said they, "the Oguizi will take
them with him, for he loves them."</p>

<p>Two days afterwards, I bade good-bye to Rotembo.
He invoked the spirits of his ancestors, and came to
the shore to see me off. He had given me people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
and a canoe to take me to another part of the great
forest, to a great king who was his father-in-law.
And with the stars and stripes floating at the stern of
my canoe I was paddled out of sight of Rotembo and
his village.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
